"I woke up this morning to find a variation of this headline splashed all over my news feed:

Bill Clinton: ‚ÄòNatural‚Äô For Foundation Donors to Seek Favors

Here‚Äôs Google:

Naturally, my reaction was ‚Äúoh, s**t, what did Bill Clinton do to damage his wife‚Äôs campaign now?‚Äù

Of course, the headline sounds really, really awful. It plays right into the idea that the Clinton Foundation is all about pay to play, just like Donald Trump has been saying all along. Unfortunately, it takes reading beyond the headlines, which is something most people don‚Äôt do, to find out the real story ‚Äì and the real story is that there is no pay to play.

‚ÄúIt was natural for people who‚Äôve been our political allies and personal friends to call and ask for things. And I trusted the State Department wouldn‚Äôt do anything they shouldn‚Äôt do,‚Äù Clinton told NPR in an interview that aired Monday morning. Source: CNN

In other words, people can ask for favors, but that certainly doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôll get them. Leaked emails have shown that some Clinton Foundation donors have gotten meetings with Clinton and that others were turned down. There is zero evidence of pay to play. In other words, people might have asked for favors, but there‚Äôs no evidence they got them.

Now, let‚Äôs talk about the foundation the media doesn‚Äôt like to mention, the Trump Foundation. Trump hasn‚Äôt given to his own foundation since 2008. He does collect money from others, though, and gives it in his name. He also takes from the charity and allegedly buys things like oil paintings and football helmets, all for himself, but out of charity money.

New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a September 13 CNN interview that his office is investigating Trump‚Äôs charitable foundation over concerns that it ‚Äúengaged in some impropriety‚Äù as related to New York charity laws. The investigation launched amid reports from The Washington Post that Trump spent money from his charity on items meant to benefit himself, such as a $20,000 oil painting of himself and a $12,000 autographed football helmet, and also recycled others‚Äô contributions ‚Äúto make them appear to have come from him‚Äù although he ‚Äúhasn‚Äôt given to the foundation since 2008.‚Äù Source: Media Matters

Media Matters goes on to talk about the double standard and about how clearly the mainstream media is trying to promote Trump at the cost of Clinton‚Äôs candidacy:

Journalists have been criticized for the ‚Äúdouble standard‚Äù in the ways they cover Trump and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Earlier this month, cable news programs devoted 13 times more coverage to Clinton‚Äôs pneumonia diagnosis as The Washington Post‚Äôs reporting about the Trump Foundation. This week, both the Trump Foundation and Trump Organization stories were given short shrift by the broadcast news programs in favor of coverage of Donald Trump‚Äôs Dr. Oz stunt.

All of this biased coverage is hurting Clinton and helping Trump. Trump has seen major gains over the last few weeks, largely because the media covers every minor Clinton ‚Äúscandal‚Äù (if you call getting sick a ‚Äúscandal‚Äù) while ignoring every scandal in Trump‚Äôs closet, and trust me, there are a lot.

"Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ‚Äúlikely increased‚Äù the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.

The congressional report, titled,‚ÄúThe Clinton Foundation and The India Success Story,‚Äù was initiated by Rep. Marsha Blackburn, a Tennessee Republican and vice-chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative.

The congressional report focused on Clinton‚Äôs decade-long relationship with a controversial Indian drug manufacturer called Ranbaxy, which CHAI used as one of its main distributors of HIV/AIDS drugs to Third World countries.

It also highlighted the work of Dinesh Thakur, a former Ranbaxy employee who became a star whistleblower and permitted the U.S. government to launch a landmark lawsuit against the Indian firm. The company was vulnerable to U.S. prosecution because it also sold its generic drugs on the U.S. market.

Ranbaxy ultimately pleaded guilty in 2013 to seven criminal counts with intent to defraud and the introduction of adulterated drugs into interstate commerce.

The Department of Justice further levied a $500 million fine and forfeiture on the company.

‚ÄúThis is the largest false claims case ever prosecuted in the District of Maryland, and the nation‚Äôs largest financial penalty paid by a generic pharmaceutical company,‚Äù said U.S. Attorney for the District of Maryland Rod J. Rosenstein when Ranbaxy pleaded guilty.

‚ÄúWhen companies sell adulterated drugs, they undermine the integrity of the FDA‚Äôs approval process and may cause patients to take drugs that are substandard, ineffective, or unsafe,‚Äù said Stuart F. Delery, acting assistant attorney general for the civil division of the Department of Justice, when the government announced its action against the Indian company.

The Department of Justice stated in its final settlement, ‚Äúalleged due to the company‚Äôs diluted drugs, it ‚Äòsubjected patients to increased risks of morbidity and mortality,‚Äô‚Äù according to the report.

‚ÄúThe question becomes, ‚Äòhow many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,‚Äô‚Äù asked Blackburn in an interview with TheDCNF.

The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign.

Blackburn said she delivered the report to the inspector generals at the Department of Health and Human Services and to the Department of State, where Hillary served as secretary of state during President Barack Obama‚Äôs first term.

The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission.

The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA.

It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù drugs.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the U.S. Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ‚Äúmore than $1.8 million packages.‚Äù

‚ÄúSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,‚Äù Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told TheDCNF.

Thakur told TheDCNF that many of the company‚Äôs anti-retroviral drugs were used to stabilize platelet and white blood cell counts in AIDS patients.

‚ÄúThese drugs allow it to stabilize and essentially provide immunity to patients. If the content of the medicine is not what is listed on the label, you will not see the platelet levels or the WBC levels stabilize,‚Äù he said.

Ranbaxy‚Äôs first public hint of problems occurred in August 2004, one year after CHAI began working with the firm. The World Health Organization reported irregularities involving three Ranbaxy drugs in South Africa, according to the report.

The FDA sent a public ‚Äúwarning letter‚Äù to Ranbaxy in 2006 about reported irregularities in the company‚Äôs quality control efforts. It concluded that the drugs, which included anti-retroviral HIV/AIDs medications, ‚Äúshow much lower potencies in these batches.‚Äù

Although Ranbaxy‚Äôs generic drugs are now barred from being sold in the U.S., CHAI and the former president continue to praise Ranbaxy and distribute the company‚Äôs HIV/AID drugs to patients abroad.

Bill heaped praise on Ranbaxy in 2013 during a speech in Mumbai, saying, the drugs saved millions of lives.

Neither CHAI nor the Clinton Foundation have announced they severed ties with Ranbaxy.

Thakur said he‚Äôs now a public health activist who tries to get global health charities to focus on the quality of drugs rather than simply on ‚Äúaccess‚Äù to patients.

The whistleblower tried to meet with CHAI and Clinton Foundation officials, but was only met with silence. ‚ÄúI have tried to reach out to them,‚Äù he told TheDCNF. ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt had a great amount of success with the Clinton Foundation.‚Äù

CHAI was a part of the Clinton Foundation until 2010, when it spun off into a separate entity. The groups still have some overlapping board members and staff, and they continue to operate in close coordination. Bill Clinton, for example, is deeply involved with both organizations.

Charles Ortel, a Wall Street analyst who has been an outspoken critic of the legal missteps by the Clinton Foundation, claims their separation was ‚Äúdeeply suspect.‚Äù

‚ÄúIn the application, trustees of the new entity, including Bill Clinton, falsely claim the entity is not a successor to previous efforts. This is not true. They purposefully obscure the fact that a similar operation called ‚ÄòCHAI‚Äô was by far the largest piece of the original Foundation,‚Äù Ortel told TheDCNF.

The congressional study suggests Bill may have relaxed quality standards in a 2000 executive order.

He signed an executive order that, ‚Äúrelaxed intellectual property policy standards,‚Äù promising the U.S. government ‚Äúwould not revoke or revise the intellectual property laws of any ‚ÄòSub-Saharan country‚Äô relating to HIV/AIDS medicines or technologies,‚Äù the report states.

CHAI announced in October 2003 it was going to distribute generic, low-cost HIV drugs from four foreign drug manufacturers: Ranbaxy; Cipla of Mumbai, India; Matrix Labs of Hydrabad, India; Aspen Pharmacare of Johannesburg, South Africa.

CHAI‚Äôs endorsement also allowed Ranbaxy to manufacture HIV drugs that would be bought by the U.S. government under the President‚Äôs Emergency Plan for AIDS relief ‚Äî a $15 billion initiative proposed by former President George W. Bush.

The flow of U.S. funds combined with Clinton‚Äôs endorsement allowed the four foreign drug manufactures to become ‚Äúgood acquisition targets,‚Äù according to the study.

Ranbaxy filed 10 abbreviated new drug applications, three of which were approved by the FDA, according to the congressional study. Eventually, the firm would produce 13 generic HIV drugs.

The companies enjoyed great financial profits and they ‚Äúexploded as they partnered with the Foundation for several years,‚Äù the report states.

The study also examined the key players in the Clinton-CHAI orbit, the potential for corruption and how the program ultimately benefited the Clinton Foundation in terms of donor contributions.

One relationship unearthed by the report was the American Indian Foundation, which Clinton co-founded with Indian-American businessmen Rajat Gupta and Vinod Gupta in 2001.

Rajat was convicted of insider trading in 2012 in a sensational trial.

Vinod eventually was forced to resign as CEO and chairman of the company InfoGroup and was fined $9 million in a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation. One of the charges stated Vinod had awarded Bill $3.3 million without board approval.

Blackburn says the worst part of the story were the ‚Äúfalse hopes‚Äù offered by the Clinton Foundation.

‚ÄúYou think about the emotional state of health care workers as they are dealing with these individuals and the emotional state of the patients. To me it‚Äôs disturbing and very sad,‚Äù she said.

"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter‚Äôs apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton‚Äôs apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary‚Äôs stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

"Donald Trump is, well, deplorable. He‚Äôs suggested building a wall to keep invading hordes of brown-skinned ‚Äúrapists‚Äù and ‚Äúdrug dealers‚Äù from charging into the country, gotten on board with creating a national registry for Muslims like Hitler did with the Jews, forcing said Muslims to wear special identification badges, and even rounding them up into modern-day concentration camps as a ‚Äútemporary measure.‚Äù He‚Äôs even suggested outright murdering the families of terrorists abroad:

‚ÄúThe other thing with the terrorists is you have to take out their families, when you get these terrorists, you have to take out their families. They care about their lives, don‚Äôt kid yourself. When they say they don‚Äôt care about their lives, you have to take out their families.‚Äù

But he‚Äôs not satisfied with slaughtering innocents to get to terrorists overseas, He also wants to bring that idea home. In a statement on the bombings in New York and New Jersey over the weekend, The Donald‚Äôs Senior Communications Advisor explained that Trump is not fighting terrorism ‚Äî he‚Äôs fighting the ‚Äúnarratives‚Äù of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. And Trump‚Äôs ‚Äúnarrative‚Äù is ‚Äúkill them all‚Äù:

Last weekend‚Äôs attacks, which are just the latest to be carried out on U.S. soil on President Obama‚Äôs watch, should be a wakeup call for every American. It is highly disturbing and entirely unacceptable that 858 immigrants from dangerous countries have slipped into our country and been granted full U.S. citizenship because of the failed policies supported by President Obama and Hillary Clinton. Even worse, Clinton must explain her reckless support for a 550% increase in Syrian refugees and her push for an all-out open border policy, which will put even more Americans at risk. The threat from radical Islamic terrorism has only grown under Obama and Clinton, and ISIS has greatly expanded the number of countries where it is fully operational. Our enemies neither fear nor respect Hillary Clinton, and as a nation, that is dangerous, and it is disgraceful. Mr. Trump will bring an end to these attacks, because unlike Obama and Clinton, he believes we‚Äôre in more than a fight about ‚Äònarratives‚Äô ‚Äì these terrorists pose an existential threat to our country and our values and they must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.

Pay attention to that last bit: ‚ÄúThey must be destroyed before they can harm any more of our citizens.‚Äù

Now, we already know that the problem according to the GOP presidential nominee is ‚Äúradical Islamic terrorism,‚Äù and that Trump has (numerous times) blamed Muslims in general for any attacks he could. Exactly how selective do you think he will be in eliminating ‚Äúterrorists?‚Äù

‚ÄúThey‚Äôre protecting each other, but they‚Äôre really doing very bad damage ‚Äî they have to open up to society and report the bad ones,‚Äù Trump said in March. ‚ÄúWhen they see trouble, they have to report it. They are absolutely not reporting it, and that‚Äôs a big problem.‚Äù

If Muslims are ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù terrorists, are they not terrorists in Trump‚Äôs eyes? How many days in his presidency would pass before anyone who follows Islam was rounded up? Would there be mass exterminations? Trump has already suggested slaughtering terrorists‚Äô families. How would he define terrorism?

These are all questions it is unlikely that Mr. Trump will answer for himself ‚Äî but remember he is exactly the sort of person who, with a wink and a nod, suggests disarming his political opponents‚Äô security to ‚Äúsee what happens‚Äù to them (shortly after suggesting that ‚ÄúSecond Amendment People‚Äù could deal with them. We‚Äôre dealing with an unstable, constantly suspicious person whose first instinct in conflict is to push the ‚Äòlittle red button‚Äô that launches our nuclear arsenal.

It‚Äôs also important to remember that the attacks in New York and New Jersey were committed by an American citizen ‚Äî one with Constitutional rights, no matter how much someone wants to call for blood. This, of course, matters not to The Donald.

Normally, suggesting that a candidate will bring back concentration camps and murder civilians is hyperbole. But not with Trump. He‚Äôs said it himself. Many times.

If we allow this alleged human, this Oompa Loompa who has escaped from the chocolate factory to wreak havoc on our nation ‚Äî to assume office, it will not end well. Be sure to vote in November if it‚Äôs the last thing you do. If Trump wins, it may be.

"When President Obama spoke at the United Nations he espoused the One World Government. He speaks of globalization in the fondest of terms: As if it is the do-all be-all for all the problems in the world. Also in the speech he referred to ‚Äútrue democracy.‚Äù If that is what he is for, then God help us.

As Written By Alex Pfeiffer for Daily Caller:

‚ÄòCollision of cultures‚Äô

In his last address before the United Nations Tuesday, President Barack Obama acknowledged that globalism has led ‚Äúto a collision of cultures‚Äù but urged countries to embrace liberal democracy and internationalization.

Obama told world leaders to recognize that violence and poverty are at historic lows.

‚ÄúI believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to carry this progress forward,‚Äù Obama said. ‚ÄúIn order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction.‚Äù

The president said those who trumpet the benefit of globalization have ignored inequalities in their countries and ‚Äúthe enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities.‚Äù Obama added that many government institutions around the world have been unfit to handle the changes globalization has brought‚Ä¶.."
"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation ‚Äì where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners ‚Äì the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed ‚Äúgood‚Äù that the foundation has done over the years.

I don‚Äôt think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they‚Äôre an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization‚Äôs IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and ‚Äúother expenses.‚Äù The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization‚Äôs IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as ‚Äúother expenses,‚Äù while the remaining almost $851K was marked as ‚Äúprofessional fundraising expenses.‚Äù Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more ‚Äúother expenses‚Äù in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

"On September 15, Hillary ‚Äúapparently‚Äù held a rally in the Old Student Recreational Center at the University of North Carolina in Greensboro, NC. This was her first public appearance since she convulsed and had to be lifted into her van following the 9-11 memorial in NYC. Hillary‚Äôs campaign was quick to blame the heat until they discovered conservative websites were able to quickly access the weather and determine that it was a balmy 74 degrees in NYC! Hillary was quickly whisked away to her daughter Chelsea‚Äôs apartment following her ‚Äúincident,‚Äù passing more than one hospital on the way to ‚Äúrecuperate.‚Äù Did Hillary recover from her ‚Äúincident‚Äù or was this rally faked to make it look like she did?

Here is the first video of Hillary‚Äôs Greensboro, NC rally that was causing viewers to ask ‚Äúwhat the heck are those cameras in Hillary‚Äôs ‚Äòaudience‚Äô pointing at?‚Äù If you look closely, it sure isn‚Äôt Hillary!

Watch this video first, and then the video below to get a closer analysis of what appears to be a phony rally for Hillary at

https://twitter.com/WDFx2EU5/status/777263623915745280

This stunning video takes the viewer through and shows step-by-step where the audience is faked:

Here is the actual video from C-Span to prove nothing was doctored in the videos above. Holy moly!"
"I can‚Äôt wait for ‚ÄúWeekend at Chelsea‚Äôs‚Äù to hit the big screen. CNN and the rest of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs slobbering media sycophants have already written the script. If this woman, God forbid, dropped dead on the sidewalk tomorrow, these doting suck-ups ‚Äì these mass media strumpets whose voter trust has, understandably, reached an all-time low ‚Äì would dutifully parrot the Clinton campaign talking points and call it a ‚Äúminor setback‚Äù to her ‚Äúinevitable‚Äù victory.

The American people aren‚Äôt buying it. This is a severely ill woman. No more ‚Äúconspiracy theory‚Äù dismissals. Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs ‚Äúmild cold,‚Äù er, ‚Äúseasonal allergies,‚Äù I mean ‚Äúheat exhaustion,‚Äù that is to say ‚Äúminor case of pneumonia‚Äù is, evidently, of the rare kind that requires a permanent traveling physician and a ‚Äúmystery man‚Äù who rushes to her side whenever she has one of her frequent and uncontrollable ‚Äúepisodes‚Äù (or otherwise freezes up with a brain ‚Äúshort-circuit‚Äù during a speech).

This guy has been spotted with the Clintons during medical emergencies going back to 2003 when Hillary suffered a brain blood clot (also covered up) and carries in hand what many medical experts say is a Diazepam pen. Diazepam is an intravenous drug used to treat seizures.

Blue tinted glasses of the sort Mrs. Clinton was wearing Sunday when she collapsed are also worn by patients who suffer seizures. These therapeutic specs are likewise used to relieve symptoms of Parkinson‚Äôs disease ‚Äì a neurological disorder from which a number of doctors indicate Mrs. Clinton likely suffers (since when has ‚Äúpneumonia‚Äù required a neurological squeeze test?).

The Clinton campaign needs to come clean. They won‚Äôt, but they should. I wonder what official ‚Äúdiagnosis‚Äù we‚Äôll get the next time she seizes up and collapses into the arms of eerily calm Secret Service agents acting as though they‚Äôve been there a hundred times before. ‚ÄúNothing to see here, folks. Secretary Clinton‚Äôs sciatica is just acting up a bit from the 30 miles she ‚Äòpowered through‚Äô yesterday going door-to-door.‚Äù

The point is that, once more, by lying about illness Mrs. Clinton has reinforced (and justified) concerns about both her physical and moral fitness to serve as president. She‚Äôs proven, yet again, that she can‚Äôt be trusted. She has confirmed a number of pre-conceptions that voters, as revealed by her historically low approval ratings, have formed relative to her health and character. She‚Äôs a liar. That‚Äôs her default mode. She‚Äôs corrupt. And she‚Äôs sick. Very sick. She puts her own personal political ambition and lust for power above all else ‚Äì including the best interests of the nation, and even her own life.

Do I take joy in Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs sufferings and plummeting poll numbers? Well, no on the first, yes on the second. ‚ÄúDo not gloat when your enemy falls; when they stumble, do not let your heart rejoice‚Äù (Proverbs 24:17).

Indeed, Mrs. Clinton has had a very bad week, but her poll numbers were already trending downward. Her medical crisis over the weekend, coupled with her stepping in it by smearing half of Donald Trump‚Äôs supporters as a ‚Äúracist‚Äù and ‚Äúirredeemable‚Äù ‚Äúbasket of deplorables,‚Äù has only served to accelerate the plunge.

Perhaps this is because of the glaring hypocrisy associated with such a statement ‚Äì especially by this particular woman. This is the same Hillary Clinton who once called the late Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., her ‚Äúfriend and mentor.‚Äù Sen. Byrd, of course, was a recruiter for the actually deplorable KKK. This is the same Hillary Clinton whose husband, former president Bill Clinton, was caught jokingin 2008 that President Obama should be carrying his bags ‚Äì the same woman whose Democratic Party opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act while Republicans, not unlike those she just slandered, worked hard to pass it. Finally, and going back a bit further, this is the same Hillary Clinton whose party fought a war to maintain slavery in the U.S. while hundreds-of-thousands of Republicans gave up their lives to free them.

Who‚Äôs the racist?

I‚Äôm praying for Hillary Clinton. Despite what her campaign and worshipful media disciples are peddling, and notwithstanding her being caught in lie after lie, our eyes have been telling us the truth for months, maybe even years now. To watch this increasingly frail, bitter and elderly woman stiffen up, convulse and collapse into the arms of well-practiced staffers is hard to stomach. You can‚Äôt help but feel some modicum of compassion for her, wicked though she may be.

It‚Äôs almost tragic to witness. Hillary Clinton has lived her entire life for this moment. Everything she‚Äôs ever done or said, and the mounding piles of lecherous BS she‚Äôs put up with from her sexually predatory partner-in-crime, has been designed to place her in the Oval Office, not as first lady, but as president of the United States. Proverbs 19:21 says, ‚ÄúMany are the plans in a person‚Äôs heart, but it is the LORD‚Äôs purpose that prevails.‚Äù

Am I saying there‚Äôs no chance Hillary Clinton will win? Not at all, though I think it unlikely. Between her devoted media harpies, her team of around-the-clock doctors and a campaign staff well versed in the practice of propaganda and cover-up, there‚Äôs always a chance they might just literally carry her over the finish line to victory.

Still, it remains my humble prayer that this past week signals the beginning of the end for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs political aspirations. Even so, I also pray she might live a long and healthy life in the private sector ‚Äì a life with plenty of time to bounce cute little grandkids on her knee.

When they visit her in prison.

Olympic Committee Buckles to LGBT Groups... Makes 2018 Games Completely Unfair There's been a major change to the 2018 Winter Olympics, courtesy of the International Olympic Committee... and it shows just how pervasive the LGBT agenda has become.

"Obama made a real fool out of himself during what was supposed to be his final address to the U.N. Assembly. During it he basically said that we have no chance in defeating ISIS and other Islamic extremist groups in Syria and otherwise. He spoke heavily to the shortcomings in military power that we have in combatting his ""JV team.""

Seeing as the U.S. is the global police force, he said that we have no chance of winning this battle.

The Daily Caller reports that Obama touched heavily upon the massive growth in military and increase in militants that form the Islamic State group. He cited this as the reason that he sees no viable military solution.

""If we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to coexist for long,"" said Obama.

President Obama continued by saying that we must ""be honest about the nature of these conflicts and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.""

He mentioned briefly that there will be a military aspect to dealing with the Islamic State group he also categorized Syria as ""a place like Syria, where there‚Äôs no ultimate military victory to be won.""

Instead Obama suggested that we ""pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence and deliver aid to those in need and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.""

Which may prove to be a little difficult since these people are not the most 'reasonable' people to try to deal with.

It's likely that many of the liberals who refuse to acknowledge the strong connection that we have seen between radical Islam and death and violence. These are the same people that would just as quickly chastise a Christian for wanted to say the pledge of allegiance in school as they would catch a bullet for a suspected Muslim terrorist.

It's this type of thinking that got us into the predicament that we are in today. Pretending like there is no real threat or that we are up against some JV team get's us nowhere and instead only makes this issue worse.

It's about time we start calling it like it is and taking action. We're past the point of being polite and too afraid to hurt anyone's feelings. If we don't take action soon, then Obama's pathetic defeatist monologue will soon become a reality.

Make sure to share this on Facebook if you think it's time we take action against the very real threat that is radical Islam.

"Thanks in part to the declassification of Defense Intelligence documents, connecting those missing dots seems to have finally reveled what most Middle East observers have suspected all along, that the rise of the terrorist group ISIS and the likelihood of establishing a terror state (a caliphate), had been predicated by both the CIA and DIA, as far back as 2012.

And purposely created by the Obama Administration in part to isolate the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The documents also predicted that the support given by the West, Turkey and the Persian Gulf Arab states to the Takfiri militants would eventually lead to the establishment of a Salafist Principality in Eastern Syria.

According to investigative reporter Nafeez Ahmed, the ""leaked document reveals that in coordination with the Gulf states and Turkey, the West intentionally sponsored violent Islamist groups to destabilize Assad, despite anticipating that doing so could lead to the emergence of an ‚ÄòIslamic State‚Äô in Iraq and Syria.‚Äù

Obviously Obama‚Äôs dismissal of ISIS being nothing more than a ‚ÄúJV‚Äù team and his apparent miscalculations in not keeping a residual force in place in Iraq, seems to be (as the documents indicate), considerably more sinister than first assumed, in that not leaving a contingency force behind was viewed by most Middle Eastern experts to have been a simple yet costly a tactical error.

However the documents are also shedding light on details referencing weapons operations inside Libya before the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi.

And the report leaves no doubt that U.S. intelligence agencies were fully aware that weapons were being shipped from Benghazi to Syrian ports.

However what isn‚Äôt in dispute is that American servicemen and woman and those in Benghazi have been willfully sacrificed by a clandestine Middle Eastern policy that has seen the rise of the most brutal terrorist group within our lifetime, by an administration that seems to be more concerned in concealing the facts rather than protecting our National Security.

"After collapsing just before trying to step into her van after being removed from the 9-11 ceremony in New York City, Hillary Clinton emerged from her daughter‚Äôs apartment seeming like a new person. Too new to be believed as a matter of fact, since the Hillary at Chelsea Clinton‚Äôs apartment was noticeably well and energetic. Even more unbelievable was the difference in appearance such as her being many pounds lighter, more vibrant, and apparently having a sort of drive through type rhinoplasty preformed in the short amount of time she was in the apartment. The nose on the Hillary Clinton double at the apartment is clearly different than all pictures of Hillary in the past.

The different nose is a dead giveaway, in the identification of nose types, the real Hillary Clinton has what is known as the Nordic nose, which is quite common and straight. The clone has a distinctively different nose that slightly curves downward at the tip and has a slight elevated area along the bridge, this being more of a Roman type.

Aside from the different nose types, the clone Hillary rather appears to be a younger version of the original with much less aging apparent. Hillary‚Äôs stand in also has no mole above her right lip, Hillary Clinton does.

Since the real Hillary Clinton obviously has such bad health issues that practically prevents her from even campaigning, we must assume that her clone stand in will do most of the appearances she is scheduled to do before the election, aside from those Bill Clinton will do himself.

The question we must ultimately ask ourselves is, will Hillary actually be physically capable of doing any debates with Donald Trump that are coming up? Or will she elect to have her double stand in at some or all of the debates?

What we need to look for immediately is her appearance. If she appears to be much thinner, younger, or without a cough and hoarseness, we should know, this is not the real Hillary Clinton. If she appears to be right on the mark, without any incidents of brain freeze or forgetfulness, this is the clone, not Hillary Clinton.

The biggest speculation that we all should be concerned about is, will the real Hillary Clinton ever be seen or heard as President of the United States? Or will her double conduct all public appearances, meetings with foreign dignitaries, State of the Union addresses, and speeches? It could be possible that if she wins the election, it will be her double that participates in the inauguration in every aspect, including the Swearing In.

It is a very big possibility that the real Hillary Clinton may not even play a part of a new Clinton Administration and all decisions will be made by her cabinet from the direction of her clone via an invisible entity.

If anyone thought President Obama may not be who he claims he is, such a Clinton Administration being conducted entirely without Hillary herself would make any speculation we may have about Obama seem inconsequential.

The American people are being played to go one step further than what we already have in Barack H Obama who remains a mystery man in all respects since he has his personal records sealed, to accept an idea as President. Hillary Clinton may be the first Administration in US history where she is only a figurehead, or an idea, but not in charge of anything.

"BREAKING: Did Hillary Clinton Have a Nervous Breakdown?

Rumors have surfaced that Hillary Clinton may be having a nervous breakdown.

In this video we posted yesterday, Clinton appears to lose eye control. Shortly after this event, she canceled her posh fundraiser in North Carolina scheduled for the same day, mere minutes down the road from where she was. However it‚Äôs was worse than we thought, as one of our researchers discovered this about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs schedule.

Interesting fact‚Ä¶.I just searched Hillary Clinton‚Äôs rally events scheduled between September 20 ‚Äì October 19 ‚Äì She has ONE scheduled. The rest of the events are fundraisers and the schedule doesn‚Äôt list her as a speaker at any of the fundraisers. Trump has FOUR rallies scheduled between September 20-22!!!!

There are many questions about her health, and admittedly I‚Äôm no expert. However I am a realist.

I recently posted that Hillary Clinton needed Secret Service to help her up TWO steps at this very rally. What healthy person needs help up two steps? And the secret service man had a vice grip on Clinton‚Äôs left hand.

I further predicted that Hillary Clinton would not be able to cover up her illness, and would eventually melt down.

Further rumors are the DNC is scrambling, as potential replacements for Clinton are being sought. The Democrats have a major problem here, as Sanders remains a sock puppet for Hillary Clinton, and doesn‚Äôt appear to want to be president any longer.

No matter who the Democrats choose, their dilemma remains that they have positioned Hillary Clinton as the best and only choice. Remember, her coronation began four years ago, and the DNC has the emails to prove it.

As for Hillary Clinton‚Äôs health, regardless of what you think about the eye movements and the potential for conspiracy theories, Clinton is ill. The Left won‚Äôt be able to hide this much longer, and it will vindicate all the ‚Äúconspirators.‚Äù

Worse yet, the health cover-up will reveal to America what we already know about Democrats. They are crooked to their black cores.

Expect lots more on this to surface over the next few days."
"It was late one night in the White House when Obama first came up with the idea for ISIS. He hadn‚Äôt been sleeping well. Michelle told him to take some deep breaths, have some hot milk, and rewatch Princess Bride, but he‚Äôd made it all the way to the Billy Crystal scene, and he was out of milk, and Michelle had started snoring. The snoring was loud and nasty and kind of wet-sounding, like a broken boat was giving birth to another boat. He had to get out of there.

First, he headed down to the Oval Office and tried to sleep on the couch, but it wasn‚Äôt long enough for his legs, and it smelled like generals‚Äô butts. For a long time, he just wandered around the West Wing alone. He was sad and tired and had the nervous feeling that he was doing something he shouldn‚Äôt. He peeked into people‚Äôs desk drawers and found pictures of cats and dogs and babies. He was thinking about stealing a Kind bar off one of his interns‚Äô desks, when suddenly a word appeared to him: ISIS. He grabbed a Post-It note and wrote it down. What was it? What did it mean?

It wasn‚Äôt until months later, at Coachella, that the idea started to take shape. Obama loved electronic music ‚Äî the beats, the lights, the DJs, the wonderful fans ‚Äî and every year, for just one day, the Secret Service allowed him to go to the music festival. They would hang back, and he would wear sunglasses, a flower crown, a neon tank top, and a tight European-style bathing suit and just dance. The people who did recognize him were too drunk and high to convince anyone of what they‚Äôd seen. (‚ÄúHey, bro, it‚Äôs the president!‚Äù ‚ÄúYeah, bro!‚Äù) The president would block it all out and surrender to the thumping, sick beat. He had done a tiny bit of molly with a French Canadian woman named Bonjour when the word ‚ÄúISIS‚Äù came back to him. Ever since he was a little boy, he had wanted to start an international terrorist organization of his own. He‚Äôd just never had the right idea. People had been starting terrorist groups for years, and he knew that if he wanted to break into the market, he needed some big new shtick. Wait. Of course. He went into his wallet and dug out the crumpled Post-It note. Yes. He would be the first American president to start an international terrorist organization, and it would be called ISIS. Bonjour was naked now, trying to bend a glow stick around one of her breasts. He gave her his flower crown, got in an Uber, and drove straight back to Washington. By the time he got home, he had a plan.

At first it was difficult to get people to believe he wasn‚Äôt kidding. ‚ÄúI want to be the founder of a new terrorist group,‚Äù he‚Äôd tell them. They‚Äôd laugh and say something like, ‚ÄúHey, Mr. President, please don‚Äôt ever say that again publicly!‚Äù Obama felt like one of the characters trying to start a luxury denim business on the HBO show How to Make It in America. Then, finally, he decided the only person who could really help him was Hillary.

They were down in the kitchen one night eating Popsicles and staring into each other‚Äôs eyes when he asked if he could tell her a secret. Hillary laughed and said, ‚ÄúIs it about how you‚Äôre really a terrorist?‚Äù He looked at her and said, ‚ÄúYes, actually.‚Äù She stopped eating her Popsicle. ‚ÄúDonald Trump was right about you?‚Äù He nodded. ‚ÄúAbout everything.‚Äù

He explained that he had actually been born in Kenya in 1919, and that he was 97 years old. He‚Äôd made an American birth certificate out of simple graph paper and aged it with tea bags. (‚ÄúHonestly, it took me, like, 20 minutes.‚Äù) He explained that his parents told him from an early age that he should grow up to become the president of the United States so that he could eventually destroy the country from the inside.

‚ÄúIsn‚Äôt that the plot of the first season of Homeland?‚Äù Hillary asked. Obama nodded. ‚ÄúKind of. Also a little bit of The Americans.‚Äù

No one had come close to guessing his secret, until Donald Trump. He didn‚Äôt know what had given it away. He‚Äôd been so careful. Had Donald Trump figured out the secret messages he was sending through his Portuguese water dog, Bo? ‚ÄúWait, what?‚Äù Hillary asked. She was starting to freak out. Obama explained that Bo was actually a supercomputer programmed to bark out messages in Morse code to terrorist organizations around the world, and he thought there was a chance that Donald Trump had seen that Bo‚Äôs eyes were really tiny LED screens. ‚ÄúDid you know that when Bo barks,‚Äù Obama said, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs just repeating the word dog over and over again in a robot voice?‚Äù

Hillary was quiet for a long time. She had stopped eating her Popsicle, and the whole thing had just melted away. Now her fingers were stuck together, and it looked like she had one weird fish-hand. When she finally spoke, it was almost a whisper. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre a 97-year-old Kenyan Muslim man who was sent here by your ancestors to destroy America?‚Äù Obama nodded. Hillary made a strange sound and cried out, ‚ÄúI feel like I‚Äôm short-circuiting!‚Äù Obama did his best to comfort her. ‚ÄúBo does that sometimes. Then he‚Äôll go outside and poop out a printer cartridge.‚Äù

Hillary was breathing hard. She walked the length of the kitchen, then walked the width of the kitchen, and then surprised herself by doing the first tumbling pass in Aly Raisman‚Äôs floor routine. Obama knew it was dangerous to tell someone his secrets, but it was such a relief. He felt light and loose. He felt 87 again. He took her hands into his. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry my fingers are stuck together like a fish-hand,‚Äù Hillary apologized. ‚ÄúDo you mean a fin?‚Äù Obama asked. They both chuckled with their mouths closed. Hillary told him that she would probably need more time to process everything. Then he leaned down and said in a soft, strong voice: ‚ÄúBut I haven‚Äôt even told you the best part yet. I‚Äôm going to start my own terrorist group and call it ISIS.‚Äù

‚ÄúIsis?‚Äù

‚ÄúNo, ISIS. All caps.‚Äù

Hillary and Obama talked for hours that night. When they got tired of the kitchen, they moved outside to the Rose Garden with a six-pack, a joint, and, like, a ton of cheese. They lay with their backs on the wet grass and looked up into the hazy Washington sky as Obama told her everything he imagined for the new terrorist group, and she listened and laughed and gradually finished the beer. When she felt sleepy, she put her head just inside one of his arms, closed her eyes, and let the sound of his plans to annihilate the Western world wash over her like the hot summer air. She interrupted him once to point out how weird roses look at night. He said he didn‚Äôt want to talk about that and told her, in a cool way, to stop smoking all the weed. She interrupted again to show him that she could eat cheese and take a hit at the same time, but he was not as impressed as she thought he‚Äôd be. He told her ‚Äúlike for real‚Äù they had to focus right now on starting a terrorist group, and she laughed for what felt like an hour and 45 minutes.

He was starting to regret telling her about ISIS, when suddenly she sat up, looked him right in the eye, and said, ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll wait until I‚Äôm president, and then we will secretly destroy America together.‚Äù Her words shot through him. His heart was beating fast. That was it. That was the plan he had been waiting for, and it was beautiful. In the dim light, he could see dirt sticking to her face where the Popsicle had been. She looked scary, like Jodie Foster in Nell. A weirdly big piece of cheese fell out of her hair. He couldn‚Äôt stop smiling. For the first time in his life, he felt completely understood. They put their heads back in the grass, and he tried to remember the lyrics to ‚ÄúWonderwall‚Äù as she secretly ate the cheese that had been in her hair. Pretty soon, it was morning again."

We‚Äôve all seen campaign promises go horribly wrong. One of the most famous is probably ‚Äúread my lips‚Ä¶no new taxes,‚Äù a moment in time that won an election and lost the next after George HW Bush made the promise but signed the largest tax increase in the history of tax increases. What Donald Trump just promised as a reaction to the attacks over the weekend in Chelsea and Minnesota may have that beat:

.@JasonMillerinDC: Statement on Last Weekend‚Äôs Terror Attacks https://t.co/DZlIvkcHmB pic.twitter.com/l3EVTvLcfO ‚Äî Official Team Trump (@TeamTrump) September 19, 2016

Take a look at that and consider what it says. The personal attacks on President Obama and Secretary Clinton aside, Trump just promised to destroy the existential threat of terrorism in America. He didn‚Äôt promise to increase funding to counter-terrorism units or deliver a plan to fight internet terrorism recruitment, he promised to destroy all terrorists and end terrorism on our soil.

Let‚Äôs imagine for a moment that Trump actually tried to implement this plan of his. ‚ÄúDestroy‚Äù doesn‚Äôt leave much to the imagination. While the mouth-breathers who support him are probably giving this statement a hearty ‚Äúyeeeeehaw,‚Äù the reality is that he‚Äôs talking about something far more terrifying than the low rate of terrorism we actually witness in America. He‚Äôs talking about profiling Muslims. He‚Äôs talking about Donald Trump‚Äôs version of the Patriot Act, where nobody with brown skin is safe.The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn‚Äôt just a Muslim, he‚Äôs an

The man being hunted by the FBI, for example, isn‚Äôt just a Muslim, he‚Äôs an American citizen with the right to due process. Just because he‚Äôs a suspect in a bombing doesn‚Äôt mean he‚Äôs guilty of setting off bombs. With this blanket Trump statement, however, this man would be in a deck of cards marked ‚Äúkill‚Äù and not on the most wanted list. There‚Äôs nothing that would lead one to believe that citizenship, constitutional rights or due process would come into play.

What that means is that under Trump‚Äôs dream regime, we could expect Muslim heavy neighborhoods like Dearborn and Queens to become heavily patrolled and segregated and their residents routinely grabbed off the streets never to return. Without a way to differentiate Christian Arabs from Muslims, would they need to wear some kind of identifying mark to make them easier to spot? If you think I‚Äôm being overly critical and you doubt that fascism is where an American presidential candidate is leaning, read that statement one more time. It isn‚Äôt about the narrative. It isn‚Äôt about prevention or education.

It‚Äôs about destroying the existential threat of terrorism at all costs. It may sound good to a bunch of knuckle-draggers who love to hate based on skin color and religion, but to those of us who have studied history and understand exactly what that terminology means, Donald Trump just became even more frightening.

The only solace we have is that what he‚Äôs promising is nothing but another ‚Äúread my lips.‚Äù Terrorism isn‚Äôt something you can simply ‚Äúdestroy‚Äù just because you said so. The thought of turning our streets into a Denzel Washington movie might get you a few more votes from the daft but it isn‚Äôt going to provide you with the laws you need to actually implement your fascism. Like the rest of Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign, in the end this is nothing more than a bloviating blowhard peddling fear to weak-minded, gullible morons.

"With the growing threat of terrorism around the world, and the increased hostilities from both the Soviet Union and North Korea, combined with a sustained and continuous policy of purging our military capabilities Army Chief of Staff Gen. Ray Odierno believes we‚Äôve reached a dangerous and pivotal tipping point.

Speaking at the AUSA Institute of Land Warfare Global Force Symposium and Exposition in Huntsville, Alabama, the General said; ‚ÄúThe Army is only generating enough readiness for immediate consumption, it's incumbent on all of us to understand that further reductions simply will put us into a place we simply cannot go.""

However the continued purging of our military in actuality is only a part of a much wider gap that exists between the administration and those within the military. It began early within the Obama Administration with a fundamental disregard of those military commanders who provided countless strategies and sound advice in how to execute successfully our military objectives, only to be continually rebuffed and ignored, which has given rise to ISIS all across the Middle East and into North Africa. And aside from the president‚Äôs astounding incompetence, there‚Äôs also an unbridled arrogance that has forcibly ended the military careers of countless officers.

The General went on to explain; ""Today our nation is facing enormous challenges. I believe we are at a strategic inflection point,"" Odierno said. ""Our nation is facing determined enemies across the globe that have the desire, the capabilities and with increasing capacity to threaten not only our security, but the security of our allies. We continue to witness change in velocity of instability, unforeseen just a few years ago.""

The Army has cut 80,000 soldiers out of the active force, reorganized and cut 13 brigade combat teams and three aviation brigades from the active component. Investment in modernization is down by 25%, Odierno said, sidelining ""much-needed"" infantry fighting vehicle modernization and a scout helicopter development program."
"What would possess anyone to take control of the Internet away from the United States and put it under control of ICANN, composed of 182 foreign countries? That cannot bode well for freedom of speech, thought, and ideas. Senator Ted Cruz leads the fight in these videos. Congress MUST ACT NOW!

As Written By Senator Ted Cruz:

The Obama administration is pushing through a radical proposal to take control of Internet domains and instead give it to an international organization, ICANN, that includes 162 foreign countries. If that proposal goes through, countries like Russia, China, and Iran could be able to censor speech on the Internet, including here in the U.S. by blocking access to sites they don‚Äôt like.



Right now, the Obama administration‚Äôs proposal to give away the Internet is an extraordinary threat to our freedom and it‚Äôs one that many Americans don‚Äôt know anything about. It is scheduled to go into effect September 30, 2016. Congress must act before it‚Äôs too late!

"In every state there is a law governing the method and procedure for conducting elections. The National Democratic Party, a ‚Äúpowerful hate group,‚Äù has been engaged in an all-out effort to steal elections, by any means available.

[ Read Related Article: The Democratic Party: America‚Äôs Most Powerful HATE Group

As a Christian and Constitutional Conservative who has studied political science and understands what the Democrats are plotting, it is this author‚Äôs contention that the party and its leaders are hell-bent to establish a socialist dictatorship in the United States, and will stop at nothing, including voter fraud, ballot stuffing, and any other illegal means to get ‚ÄúHillary the Horrible‚Äù into the Presidency in the November, 2016 election.

A proper procedure for the conduct of any free election is to encourage any and all citizens to vote. However, it is an evil abomination for anyone ‚Äì especially the Democratic Party, which is actively engaging in all-out efforts to rig and steal the November election for President ‚Äì to advocate voting procedures that encourage and enable voting fraud.

The proper procedure for any election is a free but fair and honest election. Only those citizens who are properly registered and eligible to vote should be allowed to do so. This translates rather simply to requiring a simple and easy-to-obtain photo ID that is difficult to forge, that requires the voter to show proof that they are a citizen, a legal resident and eligible to vote. The Democratic Party opposes this for a very simple reason; the party wants people who are potential Democratic Party voters ‚Äì but not eligible, not registered, not even who they claim to be, or not even citizens ‚Äì to vote so the party can steal the election and install the evil, tyrannical and demonic candidate, Hillary the Horrible, to become the next and last President of the soon-to-be-extinct United States of America.

Due to the unfortunate fact that the Democratic Party, the Obama administration, our treasonous Congress, and our abominably corrupt federal court system, have suppressed any and all attempts to enact laws and procedures to ensure fair and honest elections, the American people have as our only recourse in the November election, to volunteer en mass to monitor the polling places across our nation to prevent voter fraud to the greatest extent possible.

Donald Trump, despite his flaws and shortcomings, has made his positions very clear, including an outstanding and patriotic, common sense speech delivered at a campaign rally on Friday, September 23; he loves this country and his mission is to save her from destruction and tyranny. The Democratic Party, America‚Äôs most powerful ‚ÄúHate Group,‚Äù not only wants ‚ÄúHillary the Horrible‚Äù to be elected and transform America into a dictatorship and Hell on Earth, but the party will steal the election if allowed.

Let us agree that November 8, 2016 is the last chance to avoid or at least delay, the destruction of our 240-year-old republic, and given the evil, corrupt and hatred of all things good that the National Democratic Party stands for, citizens in every voting precinct in America who value Constitutional Conservatism and our Judeo-Christian cultural heritage, must volunteer to monitor the election polls. If Trump is to win, and Hillary the Horrible to be defeated, we cannot allow the evil and corrupt National Democratic Party to commit fraud, which this author believes they will do with reckless abandon if not watched with a very sharp eye by the Conservative Pro-American public.

"A Daisy of a Rerun

I am of an age which includes probably the first major political distortion in Presidential campaigning. That being the TV advertisement of an innocent little girl, sitting in a field picking daisy petals one by one, while a mushroom cloud arises in a most sinister fashion behind her.

The year was 1964 and the incumbent President Lyndon B Johnson ‚Äúapproved‚Äù that message. Only problem was that he followed the course in Vietnam which he was trying to assign onto his supposedly ‚Äúwar mongering‚Äù opponent, Barry Goldwater.

Today, as our history books find difficulty in revisiting Johnson‚Äôs deceitful war policies, Goldwater‚Äôs vindication is now generally accepted without any acknowledgment from our Nation‚Äôs media.

I mention this as a backdrop of our current Presidential campaign. Just maybe another daisy advertisement could be made, only this time, that little girl should be picking those daisy petals for each Clinton failure. Such a rendering, depicting reasons why Clinton is unworthy of the Presidency, would be shattering to her campaign.

Obviously, this version will never make it to our living rooms yet there are rumors that a ‚ÄúDaisy‚Äù remake aimed against Trump, has been mentioned. That being said, such considerations demonstrate just how desperate are the Clinton staffers.

Somehow, if those daisy petals could be offered against Clinton as I previously mentioned, its message could outweigh Goldwater‚Äôs 1964 deception, when based upon the accuracy of recent events.

Instead, today‚Äôs voters continue to wrestle with or just ignore the printed garbage which is masquerading as ‚Äúnews and views.‚Äù With the recent about-face announcement from Ted Cruz, the media‚Äôs reaction of ridicule was to be expected.

Now, another unbalanced AP report unfolded, this one detailing Ted‚Äôs ‚Äúdramatic about-face that may help unite a deeply divided Republican Party.‚Äù This in addition to previous statements in which Cruz called Trump a ‚Äúpathological liar‚Äù and ‚Äúutterly amoral.‚Äù

As the article relates, Trump countered with his nickname of ‚Äú‚ÄôLyin Ted,‚Äô insulted his wife, and linked his father to the John F. Kennedy assassination.‚Äù These actual quotes were selected for public consumption for one reason and although highly slanted and selective, it grades out under the sanctions of fair journalistic fodder.

Schools of journalism teach that Americans are famous for both their short memories and their short attention spans. So, is it any wonder that our media pundits often place the more critical details far into an article, even within the closing paragraph, since many readers turn off after one paragraph?

Another safeguard of a derogatory story, which must unavoidably be reported is that its coverage is short-lived. I say ‚Äúderogatory‚Äù when regarding the democratic and liberal policies and/or individuals. This exclusive slanting has been so prevalent that the ‚Äúliberal press‚Äù moniker has now everyday acceptance.

It is to this unbalance that the informed and curious must either work on their retention skills or record the scanty details from a pertinent event. This extra correlation is my fountain for the following excerpts which will never qualify for the public‚Äôs re-airing. Also, the blatant public disservice, when comparing the above cited quotes verses what the AP ignores, needs no further explanation.

Also, with the first debate squarely in view, the caliber of moderating will now and forever pivot upon the Candy Crowley faux pas. Especially annoying is the unchanged format and r√©sum√©s of the personnel who will rule this forum. In an effort to tone down or balance this slanted presentation, choice commentary against the protected candidate can offer a logical alternative and demonstrates reasons for its AP exclusion.

These quotes become especially prominent since both commentators are democrats themselves, and who have now reversed their opinions and are vigorously campaigning for the recipient of their former objections.

With that, consider the President‚Äôs past considerations of today‚Äôs democrat candidate, his hopeful successor, when back during the 2008 primary, Obama stated of Hillary, ‚ÄúShe will say anything and change nothing. Hillary can‚Äôt be trusted and isn‚Äôt qualified to be President.‚Äù

Obviously, the deception and the intentional abandonment, along with the two weeks of lying about Benghazi had yet to occur. Not only is this pertinent, it‚Äôs damning, given the time frame.

Also during that same campaign, future first lady Michelle offered this opine: ‚ÄúIf you can‚Äôt run your own house, you certainly can‚Äôt run the White House.‚Äù

Apparently, that one shortcoming continues to this day and while concerning if not pertinent, it is omitted from an equal public review.

Again, wouldn‚Äôt it be ironically significant to rerun that daisy commercial, only this time with documentation for each petal? That type of accounting may be even more withering than that long ago false imaging of a mushroom cloud!

Near the beginning of that same month, there was a similar incident to the one with Woods, in which a gay couple was attacked by two men.

‚ÄúI am saddened to hear of the homophobic assaults in Brighton over the last two weekends,‚Äù Sgt. Peter Allan said. ‚ÄúI am pleased, however, that the victims are recovering from their physical injuries and that prompt arrests were made in both cases.‚Äù

No matter how you feel about them, the gay community is no doubt one of the most accepting groups out there. That being said, it would make sense that the incredibly welcoming community would fit right in with Islamic followers and their ‚Äúreligion of peace,‚Äù right?

Wrong. Shariah law, the Islamic legal system, states that homosexuality is an abominable form of sexual sin punishable by death.

Many American Muslims are much less orthodox, accepting society‚Äôs moral evolution when it comes to things the Quran explicitly condemns and requires be punished. But in the end, radical Islam and the gay community cannot ‚Äúco-exist‚Äù ‚Äî which is exactly what Aaron Woods learned, to his sorrow."
"A man wearing a security uniform entered a mall in St. Cloud, Minnesota on Saturday night. He began shouting Allahu Akbar as he stabbed 9 shoppers.

The attacker is reported to have asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before stabbing the person.

The attacker has now been identified as Somali immigrant, Dahir Adan, a Muslim.

Dahir Adan
Dahir Adan
St. Cloud Somali-American community members are the ones who identified Adan as the terrorist, reported SC Times.

On Sunday ISIS claimed that Adan was one of their own.

Adan‚Äôs terror attack came on the heels of a bomb being detonated at a Marine Corps race in New Jersey, a Muslim man attacking New York police with a meat cleaver, and a bomb exploding in Chelsea, Manhattan that injured 29 civilians on Saturday.

Members and officials of the St. Cloud Somali community made a statement expressing support for the terrorist‚Äôs family.

The Somali officials said that Adan was a good man as far as they knew, and that he was an ‚Äúaccomplished student‚Äù in high school (but of course).


Jason Falconer
Officer Jason Falconer of the Avon, Minnesota Police Department
St. Cloud Mayor Dave Kleis reported to the media that Adan was shot and killed by off-duty police officer, Jason Falconer. Kleis called Falconer a hero who ‚Äúhappened to be in the right place at the right time.‚Äù

Falconer approached Adan during the stabbing spree and identified himself as an officer of the law. That‚Äôs when Adan lunged at him in an attempt to stab and kill him.
Officer Falconer then proceeded to send Adan to Allah where he will be greeted by his 72 virgins which surely will turn out to be pigs.

Last year the Washington Times reported that Obama‚Äôs administration had relocated almost 10-thousand Somali refugees to Minnesota.

The Times went on to say that Somalis are targeted by terror groups such as ISIS for recruitment, and that one organization warned of attacks on American malls.

‚ÄúTHIS POPULATION IS ALSO BEING TARGETED BY ISLAMIST TERROR ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE ISLAMIC STATE AND AL-SHABAB, A SOMALIA-BASED GROUP WITH LINKS TO AL QAEDA, ACCORDING TO U.S. OFFICIALS.‚Äù

‚ÄúAMONG MINNESOTA-BASED SOMALI-AMERICANS, AMERICAN CONVERTS TO ISLAM OR SOMALI REFUGEES, THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS CONVICTIONS FOR VARIOUS LEVELS OF COLLABORATION WITH ISLAMIST TERROR GROUPS, PLUS REPORTS OF FIGHTING WITH AL-SHABAB OR OTHER ISLAMIST GROUPS.‚Äù

‚ÄúAL-SHABAB MADE A PROPAGANDA VIDEO WARNING OF AN ATTACK ON SHOPPING MALLS AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING THE MALL OF AMERICA IN MINNESOTA. AL-SHABAB CLAIMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE TERROR ATTACK ON THE WESTGATE SHOPPING MALL IN KENYA TWO YEARS AGO, WHICH LEFT 67 DEAD.‚Äù

In July of this year, World Net Daily reported that Somali refugees in Minnesota regularly threaten women there with kidnapping and rape.

In May, Voice of America News reported that ISIS has steadily grown stronger in Somalia, and that the terror organization is now a major threat.

‚ÄúPRO-ISLAMIC STATE SOMALI MILITANTS HAVE GROWN IN NUMBERS AND ARE RECEIVING FINANCIAL AND MILITARY SUPPORT FROM YEMEN, A TOP INTELLIGENCE OFFICIAL TOLD THE VOA SOMALI SERVICE.‚Äù

‚ÄúHE SAID ISLAMIC STATE HAS WELCOMED ITS SOMALIA BRANCH AND HAS STARTED DELIVERING SUPPLIES THROUGH THEIR AFFILIATE FACTION IN YEMEN.‚Äù

‚ÄúTHEY RECEIVED MILITARY SUPPLIES FROM YEMEN ‚Äì WEAPONS, UNIFORM, ISIS SENT TRAINERS WHO INSPECTED THEIR BASES, AND THEY HAVE STARTED SENDING FINANCIAL SUPPORT,‚Äù HE SAID.

In June, three Somalians living in Minnesota were convicted of trying to join ISIS.

In July, the Somali terror group al-Shabab was approached by ISIS officials in an attempt tojoin forces to attack America.

Department of Homeland Security documents show that while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, over 31,000 Somali refugees were relocated to the United States.

U.S. issued green cards to migrants from Muslim nations over the last 5 Years

If Hillary is elected, she plans on increasing the number of Muslim refugees from Syria alone by over 500%.

Breitbart News reported that under a Clinton administration, the total number of Muslim refugees from all countries could top 1 million in her first term alone.

It‚Äôs clear that Muslim immigrants and refugees are being targeted for recruitment by ISIS and other terror groups. It‚Äôs clear the damage they can do as we saw last weekend with the stabbing attack in Minnesota.

Men & women, minding their own business, had their faces slashed open, and were stabbed repeatedly by a single ISIS convert. And Hillary Clinton wants to import hundreds of thousands more of these potential terrorist scum.

Hillary cannot be allowed to become president. Under her rule, terror attacks on U.S. citizens will increase exponentially. All because she and the DNC want to pander to Islamists in the hope that they will vote Democratic, and that their party will continue to rule.

A vote for Hillary is a vote for ISIS and other terror groups who are hell bent on killing American men, women, and children.

Don‚Äôt vote for ISIS Hillary on November 8th. Vote Trump to Keep America Safe, and to send these terrorist pieces of sh-t back to Allah where they belong.

Selah.

For a little over a decade today‚Äôs millennials have been described as being part of the ‚Äúeveryone gets a trophy generation.‚Äù Effort and standards are a thing of the past, so much so that even the standard to be a victim is at historic lows.

Would you believe that the man behind Saturday‚Äôs NJ and NYC bombings once claimed to be a victim of ‚ÄúIslamophobia?‚Äù This was allegedly such a problem that the attacker Ahmad Khan Rahami and his father once sued the police in Elizabeth New Jersey for discrimination, and also accused other members of the community of discrimination based on religion.

The journalists over at the Daily Mail did some digging into the lawsuit, and here‚Äôs what they found (courtesy of Louder With Crowder):

The prime suspect in the New York and New Jersey bombings sued his local police force and claimed they were persecuting him for being a Muslim. Ahmad Rahami said in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey subjected his and his family to discrimination and ‚Äòselective enforcement‚Äô based on their religion. The family claimed that police tried to shut down their chicken restaurant, called First American, too early each night with ‚Äòbaseless‚Äô tickets and summonses. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr, 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‚ÄòMuslims don‚Äôt belong here‚Äô. The lawsuit was filed in 2011 and reveals that Ahmad has a long history of grievances with city officials, their local police force and people who lived close to them.

No, you‚Äôre not living in an episode of the Twilight Zone right now, this is real life.

Mayor Christian Bollwage insisted to The New York Times that there was no such discrimination. ‚ÄúIt was neighbor complaints, it had nothing to do his with ethnicity or religion,‚Äù Bollwage said, adding, ‚ÄúIt had to do with noise and people congregating on the streets.‚Äù

Rahami‚Äôs family owns a fried chicken restaurant in Elizabeth, NJ called First American Fried Chicken. This is also the same town where five bombs were found at a train station Monday morning. His lawsuit went nowhere, so apparently his strategy in that particular case was that if you can‚Äôt beat them in the courts: bomb them instead.

Welcome to Obama‚Äôs America ‚Äì where even an Islamic terrorist can play the victim!

How insane is this? Get the word out ‚Äì share this post on Facebook and Twitter."
"For decades, employers have been holding America hostages with threats of taking their business elsewhere if we don‚Äôt vote the way they want. Of course, what generally happens when we vote the way they want is that we get screwed anyway. Jobs get outsourced, wages remain stagnant and regulations stop being enforced.

It hasn‚Äôt been since, well, the last presidential election, though, that we‚Äôve seen a CEO be quite as blatant about what his plans are if his side (Republican) loses. Four years ago, it was ‚ÄúPapa‚Äù John Schnatter, who threatened to cut his employees‚Äô hours and raise the price of pizzas if Obamacare went through. It did and he didn‚Äôt.

This year, another fast food mogul is making news for treating to hurt the economy if he doesn‚Äôt get his way. Andy Puzder is the CEO of Carl‚Äôs Jr. and Hardee‚Äôs. Here‚Äôs one of his commercials, which may not be safe for work:

Judging by the commercials, like Donald Trump, Puzder likely cares little about political correctness. But that‚Äôs not the reason he wants a Republican in office. He just doesn‚Äôt want to pay people more, or at all. In an Op-Ed in the Wall Street Journal, Puzder says that if a Democrat wins, either Democrat, he will fully automate his stores. Speaking about an automated fast food system named Eatsa, Puzder wrote:

‚ÄúI want to try it,‚Äù CEO Andy Puzder told Business Insider of his automated restaurant plans. ‚ÄúWe could have a restaurant that‚Äôs focused on all-natural products and is much like an Eatsa, where you order on a kiosk, you pay with a credit or debit card, your order pops up, and you never see a person.‚Äù ‚ÄúWith government driving up the cost of labor, it‚Äôs driving down the number of jobs,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre going to see automation not just in airports and grocery stores, but in restaurants.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the problem with Bernie Sanders, and Hillary Clinton, and progressives who push very hard to raise the minimum wage,‚Äù says Puzder. ‚ÄúDoes it really help if Sally makes $3 more an hour if Suzie has no job?‚Äù Source: Yahoo Finance

This threat is probably less about you and me than about his employees. Across the country, Puzder has about 20,000 employees. He‚Äôs hoping he can convince his employees and the millions of other minimum wage and fast food employees across the nation to vote against their own interests.

Puzder also has his own blog, where he writes a lot about politics and the joys of capitalism. One has to wonder if his 20,000 employees are quite as joyful about capitalism as he is.

Puzder is doing just fine. In 2012, it was reported that he made nearly $4.5 million. His profits have been up in recent years, but his employees don‚Äôt see any of that. In fact, Puzder is famous for making big stink every time an opportunity to rip off his employees is denied.

You can guarantee, though, that even if a Republican wins the White House and the minimum wage stays the same, Puzder will still be automating. That‚Äôs just the way he is: profits over people."
"The FBI has issued a letter stating they are investigating new evidence in the case against Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private e-mail server. The new evidence was discovered during an investigation into Anthony Weiner, who was caught sexting with a 15-year old girl, and who is the estranged husband of Clinton‚Äôs top aide Huma Abedin.

Apparently, Abedin and Weiner shared a laptop that potentially contained ‚Äútens of thousands of e-mails‚Äù from Abedin, including e-mails she forwarded to herself from Hillary‚Äôs e-mail account which were not turned into the FBI. What this might mean is many of the deleted Hillary e-mails were likely just recovered by the FBI. If any of the e-mails are work related or classified that means both Hillary and Huma Abedin lied to the FBI during their original investigation. Lying to the FBI is illegal, and that alone is enough to prosecute Hillary Clinton and Huma Abedin irregardless of the other potential violations of the law that were committed. This story is still developing, but considering the fact the FBI released this letter just 11-days before the election means they found something serious.

On July 5th, 2016, FBI Director James Comey laid out the evidence against Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private e-mail server, and mishandling of classified information, but shockingly did not recommend charges be brought against her. Since then, many high ranking officials within the FBI and other intelligence agencies have expressed ‚Äúdismay,‚Äù and ‚Äúdisgust‚Äù with Director Comey‚Äôs decision. Meanwhile, many military and tech industry experts have expressed similar concerns. Some going as far as claiming the decision has irreparably harmed the reputation of the FBI.

A high-ranking FBI official told Fox News that while it might not have been a unanimous decision, ‚ÄúIt was unanimous that we all wanted her [Clinton‚Äôs] security clearance yanked.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt is safe to say the vast majority felt she should be prosecuted,‚Äù the senior FBI official told Fox News. ‚ÄúWe were floored while listening to the FBI briefing because Comey laid it all out, and then said ‚Äòbut we are doing nothing,‚Äô which made no sense to us.‚Äù‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäFox News
UPDATE October 17, 2016:
The FBI has released a 100 page summary pertaining to the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private e-mail server. The documents claim a State Department official ‚Äúpressured‚Äù the FBI into declassifying information in one of Clinton‚Äôs e-mails in exchange for extra agents at foreign dipolmoatic posts. Both the FBI and State Department deny the deal was ever struck.

The FBI summary also revealed a number of other questionable issues including a group of State Department officials that some called ‚ÄúThe Shadow Government‚Äù who met weekly to discuss Freedom of Information requests related to Hillary Clinton. As well as discussions concerning security protocols and procedures which were regularly breached by Hillary Clinton, and her staff as Secretary of State. There was even one incident where Clinton ignored security advice that ‚Äúplaced Clinton, her staff, the media and her security detail in unnecessary danger in order to conduct a photo opportunity for ‚Äòher election campaign‚Äô‚Äù.‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäBBC News

UPDATE October 25, 2016:
According to the The Wall Street Journal, a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official‚Äôs wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private e-mail server.

Uncovering the Cover Up: Reddit Exposes Paul Combetta
In September of 2016, several Reddit users exposed the identity of Reddit user ‚Äústonetear‚Äù, as Paul Combetta, an IT Specialist who worked on Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private e-mail server. In fact, Mr. Combetta was granted immunity by the Justice Department for his involvement in the investigation, even though Paul Combetta was complicit in permanently deleting over 33,000 e-mails from Clinton‚Äôs private e-mail server.

Mr. Combetta posted a question on r/exchangeserver asking the community how to strip the e-mail address of a VIP from a bunch of archived e-mails.


It was assumed at the time that the VIP being referenced in the post was Hillary Clinton. However, new evidence released today suggests the VIP was in fact the President of the United States of America.

Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 7: October 14, 2016
On March 4, 2015, just hours after Hillary Clinton had been issued a subpoenaed by the Justice Department, John Podesta, the Chairman of the Hillary Clinton campaign, sent an e-mail to Cheryl Mills, an attorney who works for the Clinton campaign:

From:john.podesta@gmail.com To: cheryl.mills@gmail.com Date: 2015‚Äì03‚Äì04 20:41 Subject: Special Category
Think we should hold emails to and from potus? That‚Äôs the heart of his exec privilege. We could get them to ask for that. They may not care, but I seems like they will.‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/9545
In other words, those deleted 33,000 e-mails we keep hearing about contain Hillary Clinton‚Äôs communications with President Obama. Which means both Hillary Clinton, and Obama lied to the FBI, Justice Department, Congress, and the American people. We now have definitive proof Obama was communicating with Hillary Clinton on her private e-mail server, and knew she was using a private e-mail server despite his claims otherwise.

UPDATE October 25, 2016: Wikileaks Podesta E-mails Release 18 Confirms Intent of Cover Up
On March 7th, President Obama lied to the press and told the American people he found about Hillary Clinton‚Äôs private e-mail server at the same time as the public. Cheryl Mills, an attorney for the Clinton campaign, then e-mails John Podesta the same day a longtime Clinton supporter donated nearly $500,000 to an FBI Official‚Äôs wife who later investigated Hillary Clinton‚Äôs use of a private e-mail server.

To make matters even worse for the cover up, in another leaked e-mail, Erika Rottenberg, another Clinton attorney, admits Hillary Clinton personally deleted many of the e-mails herself without oversight.

I know when I talk to my friends who are attorneys we are all struggling with what happened to the emails and aren‚Äôt satisfied with answers to date. While we all know of the occasional use of personal email addresses for business, none of my friends circle can understand how it was viewed as ok/secure/appropriate to use a private server for secure documents AND why further Hillary took it upon herself to review them and delete documents without providing anyone outside her circle a chance to weigh in. It smacks of acting above the law and it smacks of the type of thing I‚Äôve either gotten discovery sanctions for, fired people for, etc.‚Ää‚Äî‚Äähttps://wikileaks.org/podesta-emails/emailid/4099
The reason FBI Director Comey did not press charges against Hillary Clinton was due to a lack of intent. He made the argument that Hillary Clinton was not subverting the law for any malicious intent, and therefore did not commit a provable crime.

However, that was before the American people knew that Hillary Clinton was using a private insecure e-mail server to communicate with President Obama, and before we had proof that Hillary Clinton deleted e-mails personally. She also instructed Paul Combetta to remove evidence of the e-mails permanently, and did so after she had been subpoenaed by the Justice Department. This proves her intent to willfully and maliciously deleted evidence to protect both herself, and her boss, President Obama.

This suggests the White House illegally subverted the FBI investigation and forced them not to press charges knowing if she faced a judge she would have to reveal the President‚Äôs communications with her. Meanwhile, by protecting Hillary, the White House was able to ensure she was the nominee to maintain the cover up. By securing the White House for another 4-years it will prevent the American people from ever finding out what is contained in those 33,000 e-mails.

When you consider these facts, as well as the other revelations within the Podesta e-mails on Wikileaks, it is clear the main stream media is also colluding with the Clinton campaign, and the White House. In effect, the White House is using the main stream media to elect Clinton in an attempt to protect their legacy, and hide the truth from the FBI, Congress, and the American people.

"Germany‚Äôs chancellor Angela Merkel has been the biggest proponent of bringing in as many Syrian refugees as possible, adopting a literal open borders policy to bring in the migrants.

This quickly turned into a horror show, as crime was unleashed onto German cities, with thousands of sexual assaults and other violent crimes were reported over the last year.

The German people had apparently had enough of this rampant crime in Germany, because they just dealt a crushing blow to Merkel‚Äôs conservative Democrat party and voted them out by a large margin.

Merkel then took to the stage to backtrack as much as she could, citing that the migrant crisis could have been avoided, and that she regrets the mistake she made, also referring to multiculturalism as a ‚Äúliving lie.‚Äù

According to the Daily Mail,

Speaking to the party faithful at its annual conference, she repeated her catchphrase from throughout the migrant crisis, ‚Äòwe can do this‚Äô, but effectively admitted Germany could only cope if she wrestled back control of the influx. ‚ÄòA continuation of the current influx would in the long-term overwhelm the state and society, even in a country like Germany,‚Äô she said. The leader, once known as the ‚ÄòIron Chancellor‚Äô, won rapturous applause after announcing the volte face. However, she resisted calls to set a limit on the number of arrivals. ‚ÄòWe want to, and we will, noticeably reduce the number of refugees,‚Äô she told the conference in Karlsruhe. ‚ÄòWith an approach focused on the German, European and global level, we will succeed in regulating and limiting migration.‚Äô

Here she is, saying that multiculturalism is a ‚Äúliving lie.‚Äù Yes, of course, when you bring in thousands of people who have ideologies that are incompatible with Western values, it‚Äôs not great for a free society. But as long as these flip-flopping opportunistic politicians act as if they‚Äôre not a part of the problem, then we will never get anywhere.

Beware, America. Beware.

What a sign of the times it is when the terrorist who planted and detonated a number of explosives in New Jersey and New York City Saturday will be receiving better care than our own veterans who‚Äôve fought to protect ourselves from men like him. It sounds unreal, but that‚Äôs the truth in Obama‚Äôs America.

We‚Äôre all aware of the scandal at the Veteran‚Äôs Administration that broke back in 2014, which showed that the VA had inhumanely long waiting lists, and even went as far as to cover up the true extent of their inefficiency.

Trump pointed out this sick truth at a campaign speech he gave today. As BizPacReview reported:

‚ÄúWe have caught this evil thug who planted the bomb,‚Äù he said of (the terrorist) Rahami. ‚ÄúThank you, law enforcement. Thank you, police.‚Äù Then he launched in to the part the haters predictably found fault with. ‚ÄúBut the bad part, now we will give him amazing hospitalization. He will be taken care of by some of the best doctors in the world,‚Äù said Trump. ‚ÄúHe will be given a fully modern and updated hospital room. And he‚Äôll probably even have room service, knowing the way our country is. And on top of all of that, he will be represented by an outstanding lawyer.‚Äù

Watch below:

Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if our Veterans received the same treatment? Instead, over 300,000 have died while waiting from care from the VA. There are also a number of veterans who have committed suicide either waiting for direct care or psychological care ‚Äì a number of such suicides happening in VA parking lots.

We can provide state of the art medical care to a man who tried to slaughter innocent Americans ‚Äì don‚Äôt you think it‚Äôs time the government gets its act together and starts providing it to those returning from the battlefield?

I can‚Äôt imagine what it would feel like being one of the doctors using your time to rescue a man who died in a shootout with police, who had tried to massacre countless Americans due to his religious ideology. Admittedly, I think I‚Äôd be tempted to make a medical ‚Äúerror‚Äù or two."

Jason Falconer, the NRA-certified firearms instructor and off-duty police officer, who shot the ISIS terrorist who stabbed eight people in St. Cloud, Minnesota, is someone that Hillary Clinton wants to put out of business. In fact, it‚Äôs one of the primary things she intends to do first if she is elected president.

This is a brave man who saved countless lives by taking out a Jihadist. The same kind of Islamic refugee that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton just love to death. Falconer owns Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. which is one of those businesses that Clinton just despises‚Ä¶ because it has to do with guns, training people how to safely use weapons and is a protector and promoter of our Second Amendment rights. This is one of the biggest reasons not to ever vote for Hillary Clinton‚Ä¶ EVER.

From Bearing Arms:

We told you this morning how USPSA Shooter, 3-Gunner, and NRA-certified firearms instructor Jason Falconer shot and killed a 22-year-old Somali immigrant who went on a stabbing rampage inside a St. Cloud, (MN) Mall on Saturday, saving countless lives. What we didn‚Äôt tell you is that Hillary Clinton wants to bankrupt Falconer, driving him out of the business of saving lives. Falconer is the president and owner of Tactical Advantage, LLC and Tactical Advantage Firearms Training, Inc. His business interests all revolve around training law-abiding citizens to carry concealed firearms for self-defense to protect themselves and loved ones from criminal predators (and apparently terrorists). If elected President, Hillary Clinton will do everything in her power to see Jason Falconer driven out of business and into bankruptcy.

Falconer‚Äôs Tactical Advantage, LCC, is a full-service training facility with a firing range, gun rentals, firearms training and gun sales to law-abiding citizens. It is American as apple pie and one that I love.

The 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) provides limited legal protection to businesses such as Falconer‚Äôs to protect them from frivolous lawsuits that would take them under. Clinton wants to do away with PLCAA, removing that protection and exposing the business to radical lawfare.

Clinton repeatedly and falsely claims that PLCAA offers gunmakers and dealers ‚Äúimmunity.‚Äù It‚Äôs an outrageous falsehood and is vintage Clinton. She hates the Second Amendment and will do all she can to quash and eliminate it. She is the single biggest threat to our right to bear arms we have ever faced as a nation.

Jason Falconer has spent his entire life protecting his fellow citizens, first as a law enforcement officer and then when concealed carry became legal in Minnesota, he took the initiative to create a firearms training company and then a range and retail shop in order to provide the best possible self-defense training to others that he could. Hillary Clinton wants to take that away and destroy all of it. The fact that he took down an Islamic extremist probably makes her hate him all the more. Just say no to Hillary Clinton, so heroes like Falconer are celebrated, not punished."

I don‚Äôt recall in any Presidential election where the candidates health was headline news almost every day. Not only is Hillary Clinton‚Äôs health constantly making headline, but it‚Äôs also commonly a part of Presidential polls. The polls continue to show a Hillary decline as Hillary continues to show a health decline.

Here are the top takeaways from the poll:

‚Ä¢More than 40% of registered voters now believe that Clinton is in either ‚Äúbelow average‚Äù or ‚Äúvery poor‚Äù health, according to the survey of 1,501 people taken between September 12 and 13. That‚Äôs a sharp departure from another Morning Consult poll taken just at the end of August, when only 26% of respondents thought her health was subpar.

‚Ä¢The share of voters who think Clinton‚Äôs health is ‚Äúaverage‚Äù remained relatively flat at 28% in the new survey. By contrast, the percentage of the electorate who think Trump is in either ‚Äúabove average‚Äù or ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù health actually ticked upwards from late August, from 33% to 36% (just 22% believe the same of Clinton).

‚Ä¢Voters are also keenly aware of the story, with just under 8 in 10 respondents saying they had heard either a lot or some about Clinton‚Äôs potential medical issues.

While Hillary Clinton is only 68 years-old, she‚Äôs one of those people you look at and guess their age wrong by a decade. My mom is in her 60‚Äôs too but looks 20 years younger than Hillary, at least. Usually ‚Äòlooking old‚Äô or looking older than your age is a result of a hard life of drug use or serious medical problems. I can‚Äôt see Hillary as a hard drug user but lately I have grown suspicious of Hillary‚Äôs health. The suspicion isn‚Äôt from one particular thing, it‚Äôs from a long list of strange behaviors that have created concern with the press.

At one point it was reported that Hillary was taking Coumadin which led to speculation of a stroke and other malady‚Äôs. It was discovered that she had her executive staff conduct a research of Provigil, which is a controlled drug often prescribed for patients suffering from Parkinson‚Äôs, Alzheimer‚Äôs, and Multiple Sclerosis. Even her assistant Huma Abedin was caught talking about Hillary getting ‚Äòconfused and needing naps‚Äô, of which she was probably severely punished.

And then there are the videos and pictures of her looking like she passed out, looking like she stumbled, the coughing fits. Recently, another damning picture came out with Hillary unable to get up stairs alone. While this picture alone wouldn‚Äôt mean anything, there are a plethora of pictures with people holding her up in some way.



Another of the many pictures where she is physically being helped up the stairs.



Then there are pictures like this where Hillary is literally being held up while talking. It would be more rare to find a picture of Hillary not holding onto someone‚Äôs arm.



Here‚Äôs an interesting video on how the video of Hillary Passing out at the 9/11 Memorial is being taken down from the internet, page after page. It is obvious that Hillary is hiding something and her people are doing everything they can to not let the truth get out. If you see the pictures of her rallies, there are not many people. I believe that the events are purposely NOT being promoted so that her voter don‚Äôt see her in person because she looks awful.



And of course the coughing pictures, America has never been so obsessed with someone coughing. She might be the coughingest candidate to run for any office in the US, ever. Not one pic or video of her coughing but nearly every speech she gives she‚Äôs gasping for air. It‚Äôs incredibly alarming to have such a sickly candidate because she could be the next *Cough Cough HmHmm Uck Khoff Khak Khak Gack ‚Äî *GASP excuse me, President of the United States.

"Dolly Kyle has written a scathing ‚Äútell all‚Äù book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton. Hillary‚Äôs war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House. When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?

Dolly Kyle ‚Äì who was just 11 when she first crossed paths with Bill, dated him through high school and began sleeping with him once they graduated ‚Äì published the claims about the Clinton couple‚Äôs racial epithets and politics in her new book, Hillary: The Other Woman, published by WND Books.

She writes of one occasion, when developmentally challenged children were having difficulty picking up the eggs at a traditional Easter egg hunt on the grounds of the governor‚Äôs mansion during Bill‚Äôs tenure in the Arkansas state house.

Reluctant hostess Hillary had enough.

‚ÄòThe frustrated Me-First Lady demanded, ‚ÄúWhen are they going to get those f*****g ree-tards out of here?‚Äù‚Äò Dolly writes.

When Hillary arrived in Arkansas, Dolly writes, she looked down her nose at what she viewed as ‚Äòignorant hillbillies‚Äô.

She was raised in a middle-class suburb in Illinois and considered herself above the southerners ‚Äì unless she was campaigning in New York state where she declared herself to be a lifelong Yankees fan.

Hillary didn‚Äôt belong in Arkansas but here she was‚Äô.

In the governor‚Äôs mansion for eight years, Bill and Hillary were both getting tired of the routine and frustrations of the small Southern state and Bill opted out of running for reelection in 1990.

He was marking his time until he could make a move for the White House. Via: Daily Mail"

I‚Ä¶can‚Äôt‚Ä¶even.

This is absolute madness and as hard as I‚Äôm trying to process this nonsense in my head, I just can‚Äôt wrap my brain around it. I have no doubt that things are about to get really messy.

I cannot say that I don‚Äôt understand the Judge after reading the report. There are some black Americans that have a legit fear of Police Officers and their first instinct is to run. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ is this really the only way to remedy that? There are two sides to this coin, and the judge is only reviewing one of them.

It‚Äôs going to blow up in his face.

In Massachusetts, a judge just ruled a special law into play for black males. This ruling came from Supreme Court, therefore‚Ä¶ it stands as is without appeal. The problem is, are the citizens of MA now in more danger because of it?

You be the judge of that.

The job of a Police Officer is a whole other level of ‚Äúall things dangerous‚Äù then any civilian could ever imagine. They are not shoes that just anyone can put themselves in and understand the burden they have to carry in their position. It‚Äôs not possible.

You can only live that life, to understand that life. That fact, just makes the brutal attack on them, even more unfair.

As if their job wasn‚Äôt already hard enough in Obama‚Äôs America, now a judge has granted an advantage to the people of Massachusetts. If they feel that they are being ‚Äúdisproportionately‚Äù targeted, they can run.

Yes, run from the Police Officer, who now can do nothing about it. To add to that, the fact that they ran, cannot be used against them in court either.

Up until now, if someone took off and ran at the scene of a crime, that‚Äôs ‚Äúreasonable suspicion‚Äù and used as reason for a Police Officer to detain the individual at least for a short period of time to investigate. Now, it‚Äôs not important to get evidence when it‚Äôs fresh, because it could hurt a thug‚Äôs feelings.

Basically, Police who exist to protect and serve, can no longer truly protect or serve‚Ä¶if there‚Äôs a runner.

Which‚Ä¶let‚Äôs be real, what thug doesn‚Äôt run?

Punchline: The law abiding ones!

I‚Äôm so funny.

Bernard Sansaricq, former president of the Haitian Senate, issued a blistering statement condemning the Clinton Foundation, which has been posted at Donald Trump‚Äôs campaign website.

Sansaricq‚Äôs statement says:

Sadly, when an earthquake rocked the nation of Haiti in 2010, corruption moved in faster than the help so desperately needed. Today, the people of Haiti are still suffering despite the billions of dollars that have flowed into the Clinton Foundation.

The Clintons exploited this terrible disaster to steal billions of dollars from the sick and starving people of Haiti. The world trusted the Clintons to help the Haitian people during their most desperate time of need and they were deceived.

The Clintons and their friends are richer today while millions still live in tents. The world deserves to know where the money went and why help was never sent.

The situation Sansaricq refers to is discussed in detail here, and also features prominently in Peter Schweizer‚Äôs book Clinton Cash: The Untold Story of How and Why Foreign Governments and Businesses Helped Make Bill and Hillary Rich.

Speaking at a Trump rally last Friday, Sansaricq accused President Bill Clinton of trying to bribe him. He said his visa was revoked after he refused the offer.

German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally admitted to the press that if she could go back in time to change her stance on her open migrant policy she would. She is also admitting she is willing to consider a new policy direction. Merkel told the media at a press conference,

‚ÄúIf I knew what change in refugee policy the people in Germany want, I would be prepared to consider it.‚Äù

These comments came shortly after the defeat of the Christian Democratic Union in Berlin‚Äôs Sunday elections. She also said,

‚ÄúIf I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.‚Äù

She took responsibility for the poor election results after finding out the results of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern election. Callying the defeat bitter and saying that she took full responsibility as the parties leader and as the countries leader.

The results of the edition are considered to be as a result of the anti migrant sentiment many Germans now have. As well as the rise of the anti mass migration Alternative for Germany known as AfD. These factors have forced Merkel to at least consider a change in her stance.

Regardless of her new admission she all but flat out dismissed the possibility that she would actually implement the change she says she deeply regrets. In other words it is all talk and no walk. She is willing to regret because it makes her look good but not enough to actually implement the change people so desperately want.

However, she did say she would not embrace the critiques and criticisms of the Christian Social Union. They have notoriously called for a cap on the migrants coming into Germany each year. They specifically want to cap it at 200,000. As well, they want to prioritize Christian migrants over Muslims. But Merkle will not budge on that.

Merkel stated,

‚ÄúIf people don‚Äôt want Muslim asylum-seekers purely because of their religion, that is contrary to our party principles and to Germany‚Äôs. The CDU and I cannot go along with that.‚Äù

Christian Social Union party leader Horst Seehofer threatened to withdraw support for Merkle during her 2017 campaign. Specifically for not implementing the migrant cap. The campaign will be in the federal election. He said,

‚ÄúIt is high time we find common ground to survive at the next election.‚Äù

The growing anti migrant atmosphere has been a direct result of an increase in terrorism, increasing migrant crime as well as violent crime. Which people automatically associate with more incoming refugees. Understandably so. If it ain‚Äôt broke don‚Äôt fix it.

This could perhaps be an indicator as well that she could lose in the next federal election. Or at least win by an only marginal amount. Serves her right considering her policies are as progressive as President Obama‚Äôs and Hillary Clinton‚Äôs. She is no different which is why many Americans too cannot stand her."

Muslim Somali asylum seeker, Abdullah, in Sundsvall, Sweden is a bastard! Abdullah is well-known by police for his multiple convictions of violent crimes, assaults and molestations. This aggressive piece of garbage has been collecting welfare benefits and committing crimes since he came to Sweden 5 years ago. His most recent crime wasn‚Äôt to any stranger this time it was to his wife.

He had gone out to party with friends one night after a long hard day of doing nothing but living off taxpayers money. Before he left he commanded (not suggested) his wife that her niece she was babysitting MUST be gone before he returned from his night of pleasure. Because he beat her regularly she knew that he meant it.

The story takes a sad turn when he returns home and sees that the niece is still there so his Muslim right to punish his PREGNANT wife for her disobedience comes into play. He forced her to the ground so he could kick her in the head and stomach. He then proceeded to humiliate her further by pouring beer all over her. That is strange to me since Muslims aren‚Äôt supposedly suppose to have alcohol, I wonder why it was there in the first place. He then finished off her humiliation by pulling down his pants and soaking her hair and body with his urine.

Thank you Mohammad for your wise words on how to treat a ‚Äòdisobedient‚Äô woman. Especially when pregnant.

Quran 4:34 ‚Äî So righteous women are devoutly obedient, guarding in [the husband‚Äôs] absence what Allah would have them guard. But those [wives] from whom you fear arrogance ‚Äì [first] advise them; [then if they persist], forsake them in bed; and [finally], strike them. But if they obey you [once more], seek no means against them. Indeed, Allah is ever Exalted and Grand.

Just in case there was any doubt as to the proper interpretation of ‚Äúbeat them,‚Äù the Islamic prophet Muhammad modeled it literally, telling a visibly battered woman to return to her husband and fulfill his sexual desires and later striking his favorite wife in the chest.

I wonder where it says you can pick and choose WHICH edicts from the Quran and hadith you want to obey? This guy is swilling alcohol and abandoning his wife at night but gets to come home and beat her with his hands and fists. I believe the Quran instructs to only beat her with a switch but I guess this nasty louse missed going to mosque too many times OR someone is writing yet another instruction book of terror for Muslims which he is following."
"Pennsylvania Republicans are trying to jam a bill through the statehouse that would go into effect immediately to allow voter intimidation across the state on Election Day in support of Donald Trump.

First proposed in June, House Bill 29 would give outsiders the ability to watch the polls in districts in which they do not reside and would give them the power to challenge voters, which would disrupt the voting process and cause delays that could prevent people from exercising their right to vote.

In other words, it would legalize voter intimidation.

As Brennan Center for Justice counsel Adam Gitlin told ProPublica earlier this month, poll watchers, especially those who decide they are going to challenge voters based on their race or religion, could throw a damaging wrench in the democratic process.

‚ÄúThere‚Äôs actually a risk that, in a more disorganized way, people are going to be showing up to the polls, they won‚Äôt know the law, and they‚Äôll be engaging in discriminatory challenges,‚Äù Gitlin said. ‚ÄúThat can create the potential for a lot of disruption, longer lines because each voter takes longer to vote, and potentially discouraging and intimidating voters from coming to the polls.‚Äù

As we all know, conservatives who support Trump are racists who think their brand of Christianity should be the law of the land, so it is likely they will challenge every black and Latino voter they see as well as any voter they think is a Muslim.

And that‚Äôs exactly what Republican nominee Donald Trump wants.

‚ÄúWe‚Äôre going to watch Pennsylvania,‚Äù Trump declared during a rally in the state last month. ‚ÄúGo down to certain areas and watch and study and make sure other people don‚Äôt come in and vote five times. If you do that, we‚Äôre not going to lose. The only way we can lose, in my opinion ‚Äì I really mean this, Pennsylvania ‚Äì is if cheating goes on.‚Äù

Trump even has a place on his website where his supporters can sign up to be poll watchers to ‚ÄúStop Crooked Hillary From Rigging This Election!‚Äù

In response to Trump‚Äôs claim that the election will be rigged against him, Pennsylvania Republicans have tacked an amendment on the bill that would make it go into effect immediately if it is passed and signed by the governor. Originally, it was only going to go into effect 60 days after passage.

With the polls showing a close race heading into the first debate, Pennsylvania is even more important now. But voter intimidation could tip the scales significantly in Trump‚Äôs favor and effect races down the ticket. In short, Trump and the Republicans are trying to steal the election by making a form of cheating completely legal. And if it works in Pennsylvania you can bet that Republicans will make sure such tactics are legalized everywhere else.

Well tell us how you really feel.

Normally when a Muslim bashes the USA, you wouldn‚Äôt think that they‚Äôre an American themselves. Such wasn‚Äôt the case when it came to American Olympian fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad,who became the first American to compete in an Olympic games wearing a Hijab.

As it turns out, she has some nasty things to say about the country she‚Äôs representing.

According to her, as quoted by The Federalist Papers:

[I feel unsafe] all the time. I had someone follow me home from practice and try to report me to police. And this is right on 28th and 7th in New York City‚Ä¶ I want people to know that as hard as [these racist incidents] are on me, they don‚Äôt come even close to things we‚Äôve seen like the shooting in North Carolina or the rhetoric around the Khan family at the DNC. It‚Äôs ridiculous and we as a country have to change and I feel like this is our moment.‚Äù

How terrible ‚Äì but let‚Äôs not pretend that we live in an ‚ÄúIslamophobic‚Äù country when the number of hate crimes against Jews is a multiple of those against Muslims.

If she thinks America is so terrible, why doesn‚Äôt she move to a Muslim country? I think we all know the answer ‚Äì because no where else in the world do Muslims have it as good as they do in America.

She‚Äôs not going to be stoned to death in America. She‚Äôs not going to have her genitals mutilated in America. She‚Äôs not going to be prevented from drinking alcohol in America. She‚Äôs not going to have her hand cut off if she were caught stealing in America.

When that‚Äôs what she faces if she were to live in a Muslim country, I think she can deal with a single incident of racial profiling."

Charlotte riots have gone mad. The idiots there turned a ‚Äúpeaceful protest‚Äù into a firey loot-filled war zone all because a black cop shot a black thug with a gun.

Go figure. They can‚Äôt even play the race card on this one, but they‚Äôll still wreck a town for no reason.

It makes sense now that the thugs in Charlotte would do an unthinkably and inhumane act such as gather around an injured cop and throw shady laughter in his direction. What did that particular cop do to deserve being injured and insulted?

Nothing. But thugs wanna be thugs, so this is what they do. Rather than get a job and start a family, these losers knock up overweight women, make multuple kids, avoid childsupport payments like the plague, and have an alarm clock that goes off everytime a black man is shot by police.

Ding ding! The looter alarm sounds and all the jobless, no-daddy, thug-a-bee losers swarm the streets and cause chaotic violence. Why? Because another black man was an idiot who didn‚Äôt listen to police.

That must mean it‚Äôs time for the Charlotte thugs to riot, loot, and lynch white people. These thugs are such losers that they assaulted a CNN reporter. The Charlotte thugs are so stupid that they don‚Äôt even know CNN is a mostly leftist outlet that would probably milk the teet of every Black Lives Matter thug.

Madworld News ‚Äì Rioters swarmed this man‚Äôs injured body and laughed at his suffering until his backup arrived to break them up and get the hurt cop medical attention. While they were addressing this situation, the animals went on to riot which eventually turned into one thug shooting and killing another. It‚Äôs okay with the BLM for a black thug to shoot another black man, but for a black cop to shoot one as a trained response to a threatening situation, all hell breaks loose. This proves that they don‚Äôt know what they are rioting for, because if black lives mattered to them as much as they claim they do, they wouldn‚Äôt be killing each other during the protest of a black criminal having been killed.

If I saw a cop knocked to the ground and injured, then I‚Äôd probably pick them up. I know if they saw me laying on the floor in pain that they‚Äôd be the first person to run towards me and lift me up.

Black Lives Matter supporters are uneducated ingrates who are most likely fatherless children of irresponsible breeding in the urban community. They‚Äôre the extremely violent thugs of America who, in between beating innocent people, also like to steal from stores and burn down businesses.

Black Lives Matter supporters are the worst people of America.

They‚Äôre a disgrace to humanity and they make black people look guilty by association. They call white people racist just because they‚Äôre white. They attack people just because they‚Äôre white.

They call every white person racist because we were born without dark pigment. How is a a fetus supposed to control the color of their skin? They can‚Äôt. But as we grow, we learn how to control our body, emotions, thoughts, and actions.

I judge Black Lives Matter thugs and supporters on their actions and NOT the color of their skin.

Based off what I‚Äôve seen so far, I can proudly say F*ck Black Lives Matter and the hoopty they drove in on."

President Obama has always been a far left borderline socialist progressive liberal. Their is no denying that. Why else would he push such ridiculous polices such as the Affordable Care Act, gun control, and an ever increasing acceptance number of refugees. Well apparently he has not changed his tune. Because President Obama appeared at his final United Nations General Assembly meeting to give his final speech as a sitting President. While there he said some absolutely ridiculous things about American freedom that will have most Americans absolutely flabbergasted at.

During his speech he effectively advocated for a one world order style of international governance and international law and order. Maintaining that the United States would likely have to be willing to give up some freedoms in order to attain that outcome. He went on to argue that global security can only be atrained through the help of international insutitions, such as the United Nations for example.

Obama said that the only freedom we should not have to sacrifice is the freedom to defend ourselves. But apparently he noted everything else is basically up for grabs. He even admitted that Amerifans criticize him for this mentality but insisted he remains firm in the belief he is right. I hope he‚Äôs enjoying that Gilligan‚Äôs Island by himself.

How ridiculous! He knows his constituents do not agree with him but he is so pompous and arrogant and stringent in his belief of his righteousness he is completely unwilling to bend and compromise. That perfectly depicts the divisiveness that encompasses Washington D.C. right now. If the leader of our country cannot broach the middle of the road why on earth would he expect other representatives to do so. It‚Äôs like parents who tell their kids to do one thing and then literally do exactly what they told their kids not to do. Then they wonder why they misbehave.

What do Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick have in common? Neither is a starting quarterback in the NFL.

The other difference is that Tim Tebow is a man of high class and well respected. The other is an idiot.

Tim Tebow was very short on words when a reporter asked him about Colin Kaepernick‚Äôs protest towards the National Anthem and not honoring a country who oppresses black people.

Tebow is known for his religious antics, ‚ÄúTebowing‚Äù celebration, and not being able to make it on another NFL team.

His comments about Kaepernick were as follows‚Ä¶

‚ÄúWhen people have belief in something,‚Äù said Tebow, ‚Äúor conviction in something, trying to stand for that is a good thing, and it‚Äôs all about standing for it the right way.‚Äô

Keyword is ‚ÄúSTANDING‚Äù which Kaepernick should do considering he earns millions for not being a starter on the 49ers. He‚Äôs a high paid bench player and he‚Äôs being disrespectful to the fans and Americans.

If he wants to protest, that‚Äôs cool, but he should do it on his own time. He can do it on Twitter, Facebook, outside of a McDonald‚Äôs next to people asking for $15 an hour. He can go on tour and to a Black Lives Matter riot. He can do a lot of things to gain attention for his silly little protest.

And let‚Äôs not forget that NO ONE in this country is oppressed.

Claiming you‚Äôre oppressed is really you admitting you‚Äôre lazy and don‚Äôt want to work for anything.

How did Obama become President? Was he oppressed? We have a black President. The guy clearly worked to get where he is, so he wasn‚Äôt oppressed.

Name one person who IS oppressed and I guarantee I can tell you why they are not.

I can tell you what they can do to better themselves.

I can tell you why oppression is nothing but a lazy excuse for not filling out a job application and doing something with your life.

If anyone is oppressed, its anyone who lose jobs to that scam called Affirmative Action.

Tim Tebow was short on words because he‚Äôs smart enough not to get himself involved with negative press. He‚Äôs too busy working on his career path.

Good for Tim and I hope he lands a roster spot on the New York Mets. God knows the Mets need help!

Screw Kaepernick."

A border wall isn‚Äôt just to keep out illegal immigrants ‚Äì it acts as a national security measure. China didn‚Äôt build their great wall to keep out immigrants, they built it to keep out foreign invaders.

We need a border for that reason too, in addition to solving the problem of illegal immigration. The entire nation of Mexico is essentially run by drug cartels, and they‚Äôve racked up a death toll that would make ISIS envious. Additionally, if ISIS is going to enter America, our unsecured Southern Border is their best bet.

And for that reason, you can bet they already are trying‚Ä¶

As the Conservative Tribune reported:

Eight Syrian nationals attempted to illegally enter the United States from Mexico on Monday, raising new concerns about security inside the United States in the wake of the Paris terror attacks. Breitbart cited two unnamed federal agents who said the Syrians were intercepted at the Juarez Lincoln Bridge in Laredo, Texas. While Border Patrol has yet to confirm this report, National Border Patrol Council Local 2455 President Hector Garza did confirm that he was also receiving similar reports from multiple agents. ‚ÄúBorder Patrol agents who we represent have been contacting our organization to voice concerns about reports from other agents that Syrians crossed the U.S. border from Mexico in the Laredo Sector,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúOur agents have heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents. At this time, I cannot confirm or deny that Syrians have crossed, for security reasons.‚Äù

It would be a lot easier to catch these terrorists if the Obama administration let border patrol do their jobs.

Border Patrol Agent Hector Garza, acting in his role as president of the National Border Patrol Council, Local 2455 said on Fox News earlier this month that ‚ÄúEight out of ten people that are caught entering our country illegally are not deported and are allowed to stay in the United States,‚Äù Garza explained. ‚ÄúUnfortunately for Border Patrol agents, we are trying to do our jobs as best we can with the very limited resources that we have.‚Äù

We need a border and stronger border security ‚Äì and there‚Äôs only one Presidential candidate willing to help with both."
"The Haitians in the audience have some newsworthy things to say about their experiences. Too bad The Media (D) didn‚Äôt stick around to hear it.

These people LOVED Trump. They cheered for him, he sat quietly as they told their stories.

Then there was how they claim Hillary screwed over the Poor People of Haiti. Haiti wanted to raise DAILY minimum wage from $3 to $5 a day. Hillary put an end to it.

When it was obvious that the audience was piling on Hillary, and had nothing but love for Trump?

There was no news there ‚Äòworth reporting‚Äô‚Ä¶ nothing to make Trump look silly, or racist, or hated.

So they left early.

The camera followed them out of the room, scurrying like the rats they are.

BUSTED!"
"When Donald Trump said that he wanted to ban Muslim immigration until we know what‚Äôs going on, every single Democrat and liberal yahoo yelled until their voice was hoarse that it was racist.

Oh how wrong they were, and still are.

First off, racism is the belief that one race is inherently better than another simply by virtue of the color of their skin. Islam isn‚Äôt a race, it is a religion that lends itself very well to radicalization. This is the same religion that has believers blow themselves up in crowded places thinking they‚Äôll go to heaven to party with 72 virgins.

The insanity, in this issue, is clearly on the side of the Democrats. After seeing how the world is working, Trump wanted to put a temporary ban on all Muslim immigration until we figure out how to stop the terrorists from coming in.

Democrats think the world will agree with them, and they‚Äôre flat out wrong. Well, this has got to sting:

A new poll has found that 49 percent of Australians support a ban on Muslim immigration, a huge jump from last October when only 28 percent backed the idea. The Essential Research survey also revealed 48 per cent of voters would welcome a national debate on the issue, and showed that two thirds of Australians agree that populist senator Pauline Hanson talks about topics other politicians are afraid to bring up. The top reasons for wanting a ban were fears over terrorism, and a belief that Muslim migrants do not integrate nor share Australian values. The poll was first conducted in early August and then repeated to ensure the results were not outliers.

So Australians want to preserve Australian values? That sounds like what every single other culture on earth wants to do. Yet, when Trump says ‚ÄúAmerica first‚Äù it‚Äôs suddenly racist.

Ok, yeah, that sounds logical.

Sixty per cent of respondents who support the right-wing Coalition favour an end to Muslim migration along with 40 per cent of Labour voters and 34 per cent of Green voters. ‚ÄúFloored‚Äù by the results, the pollster laments that the ‚Äúbasket of deplorables‚Äù, who he previously thought were just a ‚Äúmarginalised rump, out of step with the views of modern, mainstream, cosmopolitan Australia‚Äù, is too big to ignore. He writes: ‚ÄúThis not a ‚Äòbasket of deplorables‚Äô who sit outside the confines of polite society, that is 49% of the men and women who make up our nation. ‚ÄúYes, they are more likely to vote Coalition or ‚Äòother‚Äô but 40% of Labor voters and one third of Greens agree too. Look around you right now, there are people in your workplace, in your street, on your train, who agree with Hanson.‚Äù

Do you hear that, Hillary? This is how you respond to people who oppose you. You don‚Äôt call them ‚Äúdeplorables,‚Äù you recognize that half the country is against you. Let‚Äôs get this done in November.

You can‚Äôt make this stuff up. People used to tell crazy stories, but have no way to prove if the story was true or not.

Then along came video.

This is by far one of the craziest things I‚Äôve ever seen. These guys are out in the middle of the street and it looks like there was supposed to be a fight of some sort. Because you know how fights are, they‚Äôre even better when they‚Äôre in the middle of a major road.

Out of nowhere someone lights them on fire.

LIGHTS. THEM. ON. FIRE.

And they‚Äôre still in the middle of the road, running around like crazy where they may get hit by a car.

Nothing but absolute chaos and easily one of the most disturbing things I‚Äôve watched since the Casey Anthony trial.

What goes through someone‚Äôs deplorable brain when they‚Äôre thinking ‚Äì well right about now is a great time to light these guys on fire. Yup, let‚Äôs just toss this cocktail over on them and watch the men burn.

Who carries the items needed for a good Molotov cocktail anyway? Was this premeditated? It‚Äôs not like I have the items needed for a good cocktail laying around unless it‚Äôs a Bloody Mary on a Sunday morning.

Back in the day, when people were a lot smarter and America was great, this would have been a lot different.

If you see two people about to fight and they‚Äôre in the street, then the good people will make sure that the people fighting aren‚Äôt getting hit by a car. The good people used to make sure it was a fair fight and would stop the fight when it got out of hand.

That was when people were a lot smarter and had more human nature to them.

Nowadays everyone whips out the cell phone and let‚Äôs a slightly bad situation turn into the worst possible situation just so they can grab a viral video out of it.

"We need a border wall. It is not just a matter of preventing illegal immigration, but securing an essential access point into America.

Law enforcement is on high alert after a routine traffic stop revealed troubling intentions. Police in Luna County, New Mexico, pulled over an undocumented Middle Eastern woman with the plans for a nearby gas pipeline and surrounding area.
(via Mad News World)

Police were unable to determine why the woman, described as an ‚ÄúIslamic refugee,‚Äù was in possession of the plans, but many are fearing the worst.

The plans detailed a pipeline in Deming, New Mexico. The FBI‚Äôs Joint Terrorism Task Force was deployed with the U.S. Border Patrol to investigate the area. The search came up empty.

The pipeline identified in the Muslim woman‚Äôs plans is fairly remote, leading many to assume that the woman was scouting out potential targets for future terror attacks and did not have immediate intentions to launch an attack.

It is troubling to discover an undocumented Muslim woman in a county sharing a border with Mexico.

A report released by Judicial Watch in 2015 revealed that Mexican cartels were working with terror organizations. The report indicates that Mexican gangs were accepting payments to smuggle foreigners from terror-plagued nations into our country.

Judicial Watch also revealed in a 2017 report that Mexico-based Islamic terror groups have been illegally crossing the border into America to scout out potential targets.

Congress should approve funding for President Trump‚Äôs border wall at once. It is not merely a matter of preventing illegal immigration. Many nefarious groups, such as terrorists and drug cartels, are aware that the southern border is the easiest way to sneak into America.

Many of the illegal immigrants entering America are not even from Mexico. Instead, aliens from south of Mexico are able to travel across the country in order to reach the American-Mexican border. Many of these aliens receive active support from the Mexican government, who cannot support the illegal immigrants.

If a terrorist wanted to sneak into America to launch an attack, they could easily travel across the southern border. They could start their journey south of Mexico, arriving in countries without the ability to vet travelers.

The only way we can secure our nation from foreign threats is by constructing a wall on the southern border. Until we do, our country is easy pickings."
"We‚Äôre shocked ‚Äî SHOCKED ‚Äî to learn that CNN‚Äôs bias is so blatant in just about everything they do, not simply in reporting the news.

First came Lester Holt‚Äôs unbelievably one-sided moderation of the debate in which he routinely press and even attacked Donald Trump‚Äôs record and answers while leaving Hillary untouched with no mention of any of the most obvious scandals.

Now CNN has upped the ante on their own bias with a poll that isn‚Äôt worth paper it was printed on.

According to their post-debate poll, 62% of respondents indicated that Hillary won the debate. But what CNN didn‚Äôt bother to highlight is the fact that fully only 26% of those polled were Republicans. While Independents made of 33%, Democrats comprised a whopping 41% of those polled.

Not to be outdone, NBC followed up with a similar poll in which there were 14% more Democrats than Republicans."

Seahawks Quarterback Russell Wilson has never shied away from sharing his love for God and his fellow man. In fact, it is one of his life‚Äôs purposes to serve and help his ‚Äòbrothers and sisters‚Äô in changing lives to be better. Helping others to get on a path that leads to true joy is what he hopes becomes his legacy in life.

On the field he as a Quarterback, Wilson is all about winning. Off the field, he sets his focus on helping others to find the joy and peace that he feels himself through good choices and having hope and faith in God.

For this reason, it is no surprise that when the NFL told Wilson to not speak about his faith‚Ä¶he learned he could still share his love for God and message of hope, by his actions. Words were not necessary.

He has stated many times that in his life, God comes first, family and friends second, and football third. Dedication to what is most important to him, is his strength.

‚ÄúIn terms of my faith, my faith is everything: God comes first, family and friends come second, and football comes third,‚Äù Wilson concluded. ‚ÄúI think when you keep it in that order, great things happen to you. You don‚Äôt stress out about much.‚Äù

It‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see a man with a voice that can be heard in great numbers sharing a good message. We have far too many people in high places, who may have at one time in life had good intentions and faith in God to do good things in their life. Then they got to where they wanted to be and used their voices to give glory to‚Ä¶ themselves. Or worse, forget where they came from and who brought them there. Luck? No such thing.

Good men‚Äôs hearts will fail them in this world where corruption runs deep and deception is a key skill of the very leadership that runs this country.

Especially now in Obama‚Äôs America. You might walk into a room of opportunity to make a change with good intentions, but once in there‚Ä¶if you do not share in the example that Wilson has set in remembering who you are and whose message you share‚Ä¶ corruption can and will take root.

So the NFL told him not to talk about his faith‚Ä¶

Interesting how things seem so one sided right? Don‚Äôt talk about God, it hurts people‚Äôs feelings. But feel free to disrespect and spread a message of dishonoring your country and it‚Äôs heroes.

With this kind of garbage happening‚Ä¶the truth becomes that much more obvious.

Words like ‚Äòtolerance‚Äô are being used to blur the line between good and evil, right and wrong. When you have men like Wilson out there standing for the truth and righteousness he believes in, the backlash is deep.

Ask yourself, when did serving others and helping them find happiness become something bad?

There is only one who would wreck nations and terrorize mankind to keep good from happening.

‚Ä¶and Obama‚Äôs Americans seem to have forgotten that very simple truth."
"Someone had to say it. Okay, liberals have been saying it for years. Fox News (and increasingly, the other news channels) have been promoting fear for so long that they have become the terrorists. Pope Francis agrees. Channeling Franklin Delano Roosevelt‚Äôs infamous line, ‚Äúwe have nothing to fear but fear itself,‚Äù the Pope chastised fear-based media.

Journalism based on gossip or rumors is a form of ‚Äúterrorism‚Äù and media that stereotype entire populations or foment fear of migrants are acting destructively, Pope Francis said on Thursday. Spreading rumors is an example of ‚Äúterrorism, of how you can kill a person with your tongue‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúThis is even more true for journalists because their voice can reach everyone and this is a very powerful weapon.‚Äù Source: Reuters

Now, to be fair, Pope Francis was in Italy and he was talking to Italy‚Äôs press, which has its own problems with nationalism, but I‚Äôm sure he was hoping his words would hop the pond. After all, Fox spreads little but fear and that‚Äôs what has given us Donald Trump.

Crime in the nation is down. An American‚Äôs odds of being killed by a terrorist is 1 in 20 million. Those are roughly the same odds as being killed by your own furniture. Still, Trump, prompted on by Fox News, is scaring the crap out of Americans:

Fear is in the air, and fear is surging. Americans are more afraid today than they have been in a long time: Polls show majorities of Americans worried about being victims of terrorism and crime, numbers that have surged over the past year to highs not seen for more than a decade. Every week seems to bring a new large- or small-scale terrorist attack, at home or abroad. Mass shootings form a constant drumbeat. Protests have shut down large cities repeatedly, and some have turned violent. Overall crime rates may be down, but a sense of disorder is constant. Source: The Atlantic

Sure, that‚Äôs about Donald Trump and the Pope wasn‚Äôt directly talking about him, but Fox is the fear network. Forward Progressives lists several examples of Fox trying to scare the s*it out of people, and if this election and polls are any indication, they‚Äôve succeeded.

CNN news has claimed through polling that Hillary Clinton was the undefinable winner of the first general election debate. But others indicate otherwise. Snap polls show Donald Trump as the debate night winner. Talking points included the Birther movement allegations, the email controversy, and Trump‚Äôs tax returns as well as other things.

Look at some of the snap polls below. They include TIME Magazine, the Drudge Report, CBS New York, Fox 5, and News 2 Nashville among many others.

Donald Trump took to Twitter to thank everyone for polling in his favor and for their belief that he won the debate. So far, Hillary Clinton has yet to comment on it. The CNN snap poll showed Clinton at 62 percent and Trump at 27 percent. Which is a very large margin considering most polls show he won. Thus, something nefarious has to be going on with that CNN poll. Or the pool of people polled is off.

521 people were polled by CNN but the network admitted the sample pool leaned more Democrat. Which would explain the results. Despite Clinton‚Äôs win in that poll the poll had mixed results as to whether or not the debate would make a difference in their voting. So even if she won in that poll that means the results do not necessarily indicate that people will go to the voting booth to support her.

Regardless of these apparent ‚Äúwinning‚Äù results, as Donald Trump would say, he has complained that the media network gave him a defective mic. That he should have brought up Bill Clinton‚Äôs infidelity. Even going as far as to threaten not to appear at the debate. Which is odd considering he apparently won.

With the election about a month away time is beginning to crunch and the candidates have less and less time to change voters minds. Let‚Äôs not forget that Julian Assange promised a few months back an October surprise release on Wikileaks that would destroy Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. We all must wait and see."
"Oh Hillary, when will you learn? You never count your chickens before they‚Äôre hatched. Also, don‚Äôt say you‚Äôve won when you clearly didn‚Äôt.

The polls are in from last night‚Äôs debate. At first glance they do not look good for Donald Trump. According to focus groups from Fox News and CNN, both had Hillary winning last night‚Äôs debate.

But were those true tests of the voting pool on the whole?

According to focus groups at both Fox News and CNN, Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton handily defeated Republican Donald Trump in Monday‚Äôs presidential debate. At CNN, the focus group went 18-2 in favor of Clinton. And at Fox, pollster Frank Luntz‚Äôs group went 16-6 in favor of the former secretary of state. CNN‚Äôs group was a group of voters from Florida, while Luntz‚Äôs group was comprised of Pennsylvanians. Luntz, who tweeted frequently throughout the debate, said that Trump didn‚Äôt do well when he talked about his taxes but began to rebound when he knocked Clinton over her email scandal. However, Trump ‚Äútanked‚Äù when ‚Äútrying to explain why he questioned Obama‚Äôs birthplace for so long.‚Äù

But what no one is telling you is that another poll had Trump winning 92% to 8%.

Last night, the city of Charlotte was rocked with protests for a second straight night as massive crowds protested the police killing of Kenneth L. Scott. During the protests, a civilian was shot in the head and critically injured. The police quickly told the media that the shooter was also a civilian, but a number of eyewitness reports seem to indicate that the police are lying ‚Äì and that the shot came from law enforcement.

One key eye witness report emerged from Charlotte on Twitter, along with a graphic photo of the bloody aftermath and a haunting statement from Todd Zimmer, who claims to have assisted in the emergency response: ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to post about this, but my city is lying about what happened tonight. Let the record show.‚Äù

My friend @neutralized was on the ground in Charlotte. He saw the shooting. Here's his account. pic.twitter.com/H5cQXrAn37 ‚Äî Max Berger (@maxberger) September 22, 2016

We interviewed Kahran Meyer, who is a North Carolina criminal defense lawyer and a key eye witness on the scene. The 29-year-old published this tweet just an hour after witnessing the shots and noticing that the weapons discharge did not sound like a typical firearm:

I watched a man die tonight with my own two eyes. It was NOT by a civilian. I don't care WHAT CNN tells you. I was right fucking there. ‚Äî BLACK MATLOCK (@KahranAtLaw) September 22, 2016

‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt realize that I was standing next to someone from CNN at the time. It started when everybody met at the park and marched from there down a couple of city blocks, when somebody said let‚Äôs march to the police station. It was peaceful, people had signs that said ‚ÄúHands Up, Don‚Äôt Shoot,‚Äù Kahran Meyers told me at 1:50am tonight.

‚ÄúThe protest then marched to College Street and Trade Street in front of the Omni Hotel. At that time, police were not at all directing traffic, just keeping the peace,‚Äù Meyer told me almost breathlessly, ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been told that the idea was to walk into the Omni and hold our hands up [in protest] and chant ‚Äòhands up, don‚Äôt shoot‚Äô and there was a crowd of roughly 1,000 people. We wanted to demonstrate to the upper class, the bourgeoisie that there is a problem.‚Äù

‚ÄúAfter leaving ‚ÄòThe Epicenter,‚Äô police made a human barrier to block a return to the main square, so the crowd was facing the hotel. At that point, all of the protests were completely peaceful ‚Äì and that‚Äôs when the riot police arrived. I swear to god, you could feel the temperature go up by 10 degrees.‚Äù

Meyers had a brief interaction with one of the riot officers at that point, and asked them whose idea it was to send out police in heavy armor. The Charlotte officer coyly nodded his head upward as if to indicate brass. Meyers told him that it was an unnecessary escalation and he replied, ‚Äúoh, absolutely.‚Äù

Five minutes later, a protester lay near death in a pool of blood in the street.

‚ÄúIt wasn‚Äôt a gunshot,‚Äù she told us. ‚ÄúIt was much louder. It wasn‚Äôt a civilian injury. The way people scattered. No way. At least a dozen people exclaimed loudly ‚ÄòThey just shot him‚Äô and people in the crowd were familiar with him [the protester shot by police]. At that point, the peaceful protesters who hadn‚Äôt already left, exited.‚Äù

At that moment, Meyers says that Charlotte-Mecklenberg police then read the riot act to the protesters. As she made it to the next block, police opened up with teargas from two directions into the already retreating crowd of peaceful protesters.

It took Meyers fifteen minutes to leave the scene, and as she was departing she spotted a news crew reviewing live video, it was a split-screen. According to Meyer, that videographer was from CNN and had been standing next to the lawyer, and when reunited said it was ‚Äòentirely too loud for a gunshot too. It was so loud it shook my tripod and all of my equipment.‚Äô

CNN reports, ‚ÄúPolice say the person was shot by a civilian.‚Äù

The City of Charlotte began spinning the protester‚Äôs grave injuries immediately on Twitter:

ALERT: Fatal shot uptown was civilian on civilian. @CMPD did not fire shot. ‚Äî City of Charlotte (@CLTgov) September 22, 2016

Two additional eye witness reports have emerged on Twitter refute the Charlotte police‚Äôs claim that a civilian shot and severely injured a protester. The first is from the Charlotte Clergy Coalition for Justice, who issued a press release of sorts through a widely followed Palestinian rights activist.

‚ÄúI saw the man go down on the pavement,‚Äù said Minister Steve Knight of Missiongathering Christian Church in Charlotte whose written statement points the finger squarely at Charlotte-Meckenberg Police for the shooting, ‚ÄúIt was an ambush. The victim was shot while he stood between two ministers, and we believe he was shot by police.‚Äù

#Charlotte Clergy question media & police accounts of tonight's shooting of protester. #CharlotteProtest #KeithLamontScott pic.twitter.com/TlVOwveYAV ‚Äî Linda Sarsour (@lsarsour) September 22, 2016

Lastly, a man named Eddie Thomas posted on Facebook ‚Äì which was also shared via twitter ‚Äì that, ‚Äúwithin 5 mins (no exaggeration a dude lay bleeding on the ground, eye rolling in the bakc of his head. he got shot with something, maybe a rubber bullet. I yelled at the bike cops for help and they did nothing.‚Äù

When African-Americans attempt to express their frustration and anger and the violence inflicted upon them by the state, the state responds the only way it knows how ‚Äì with more violence.

Republican nominee Donald Trump has been treading treasonous territory for months now, raising eyebrows around the nation for a foreign policy that openly supports the ambitions of Vladimir Putin, the dictator of the Russian Federation. He‚Äôs surrounded himself with men with close ties to the Kremlin and the oligarchs that pull the strings behind the scenes; he‚Äôs being openly supported by Russian state-controlled media and by Russian intelligence services, who have breached the electronic servers of Democratic Party operatives and released selected pieces of information in an attempt to sow discord.

Throughout all of this, Trump has insisted that he has no business ties to Russia. ‚ÄúFor the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia‚Äù he tweeted in July. Now ‚Äì brace yourself, this might come as a shock ‚Äì it appears he‚Äôs been lying to us the whole time.

An ABC News investigation has found that Donald Trump has ‚Äúnumerous ties‚Äù to Russian interests both here in the United States and in Russia. ‚ÄúThe level of business amounts to hundreds of millions of dollars ‚Äî what he received as a result of interaction with Russian businessmen. They were happy to invest with him, and they were happy to work with Donald Trump. And they were happy to associate‚Äî[and] be associated with Donald Trump‚Äù says Sergei Millian, who heads a U.S.-Russia business group.

Trump has reaped huge profits off his business deals with Russian oligarchs that stretch from hosting the 2013 Miss Universe contest in Moscow and selling Trump-branded real estate to ‚Äúlarge numbers‚Äù of Russian buyers ‚Äì so many that the Sunny and Hollywood Islands in Florida became known as ‚ÄúLittle Moscow.‚Äù

The oligarchs of Russia made their fortunes by making deals to acquire huge numbers of shares in the state-owned companies of the former Soviet Union as the country shifted to a free-market economy, turning them into billionaires overnight. Towards the end of the Boris Yeltsin era, the oligarchs controlled 50% to 75% of all Russian finance. Now, they use their influence and wealth to prop up the Putin regime, while he turns a blind eye as they rob the country blind. Putin himself has amassed a fortune of $70 billion that could be as high as $200 billion.

The oligarchs are constantly looking to funnel their ill-gotten gains out of the country, and it turns out purchasing Trump properties was a favored way to do so. It makes sense ‚Äì they are all men cut from the same gold cloth. They are self-entitled narcissistic materialists who care for nothing but increasing their own personal wealth.

‚ÄúI think material wealth for them is a highly emotional and spiritual thing. They spend a lot of money on their own personal consumption‚Ä¶They don‚Äôt read books. They don‚Äôt go to [art] exhibitions. They think the only way to impress anyone is to buy a yacht‚Äù says former KGB agent Alexander Lebedev, who went on to describe them as ‚Äúcultural ignoramuses‚Ä¶not interested in social justice.‚Äù Sound like anyone we know?

When the US State Department leveled sanctions on the Russian oligarchs in 2014 following Moscow‚Äôs annexation of the Crimea, the oligarchs had one of their key money-laundering tools cut off. If Trump were president, however, he could end the sanctions and allow them to continue to enrich themselves ‚Äì and Trump himself. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be looking at that, yeah we‚Äôll be looking‚Äù said Trump on the issue of sanctions in July.

These business dealings obviously present a great conflict of interest between the personal finances of a potential President and the foreign policy of our nation, which seeks to curtail the disruptive and corrupting influences of the Russian oligarchs and put a check on Russian territorial aggression in Eastern Europe. Would President Trump be able to put his personal profits aside? If this election has taught us anything at all, it‚Äôs that Trump cares about nothing but himself. We cannot allow him and his Russian cronies to take their corruption to the White House.

"The man arrested Monday in connection with the New York City bombing sued his local police force over anti-Muslim discrimination claims.

Ahmad Khan Rahami filed the lawsuit against cops in Elizabeth, N.J., where he was residing before he planted bombs in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan, at a train station in Elizabeth, and on the route of a 5k Marine charity run on the Jersey shore. He claimed police were persecuting him for being a Muslim and subjecting him and his family to ‚Äúselective enforcement‚Äù based on Islam, reports The Daily Mail.

Rahami worked at a chicken restaurant called First American, owned by his family, who claimed the police tried to shut it down early each night with ‚Äúbaseless‚Äù tickets, and that locals said: ‚ÄúMuslims don‚Äôt belong here.‚Äù Rahami brought the suit along with his father Mohammad Sr. and his brother Mohammad.

He was arrested following a shootout with police Monday, after he was found passed out in the doorway of a New Jersey bar.

New Jersey‚Äôs despised Republican Governor Chris Christie is in scalding hot water as the top state legislators are now looking into filing articles of impeachment against him if he is found guilty of having orchestrated the closing of the George Washington Bridge in order to punish a political rival. Christie has been ordered to produce personal emails related to the ‚ÄúBridgegate‚Äù scandal by a judge, as WNYC reports:

The decision on impeachment will be up to Democratic Speaker Vincent Prieto and if he gives the go-ahead, the Assembly Judiciary Committee would begin the process.It takes a majority of the 80-member Assembly to vote articles of impeachment. If it passes the Democrat-controlled body, the trial would be in the Senate, where two-thirds of senators would be needed to convict. Although Democrats hold a majority in the Senate, they would need three Republican senators to join them if all Democrats vote to convict.

Chris Christie is also Republican Presidential‚Äôs nominee Donald Trump‚Äôs transition team chairperson.

Just four days ago, federal prosecutors pointed the finger at Christie at the start of a federal trial involving three senior aides to the Governor, accusing Christie of being deeply involved in the political retribution plot to shut down the George Washington Bridge to New York City, which resulted in the death of one person in an ambulance as enormous traffic jams stranded hundreds of thousands of motorists on one of the world‚Äôs busiest bridges.

Governor Christie was Trump‚Äôs most authoritative surrogate, as well as the first major ‚Äúconservative‚Äù Republican endorser, in a move which most assumed meant that his political career was over inasmuch as his public service career now depended on Trump‚Äôs benefaction. Going from a multi-year flirtation with running for the highest office to endorsing Trump last March in a widely mocked ceremony then represented a stunning level of political debasement coming from the Governor.

Famously, Chris Christie once lied for two hours straight to a nationally televised press conference, which you can see below in its painstaking detail. It‚Äôs have cued it to 1:43 so you can watch the Republican Governor‚Äôs the flat out denial of any knowledge of BridgeGate which he gave on January 9th, 2014, just two short months after his re-election, and four months after the scandal which delayed ambulances and emergency services. BrideGate literally gridlocked an entire town.

Last week it was revealed that Governor Christie was actually informed personally about BridgeGate at the 9/11 memorial ceremony in 2013 from his senior aides, and stood by, and did nothing, though his aides knew about it and called him out for lying to everyone in their electronic messages.

The Republican Governor once thought to be the future of the party is about to be booted from office by his self-defeating act of lying about his administration‚Äôs bare knuckle political bullying. We will watch this story closely, and await the reaction of Republican nominee Donald Trump the impeachment charges Christie is facing, because the New Jersey Governor is one of the pillars of this year‚Äôs Republican Presidential campaign.

Watch his shame:

During a Republican primary debate in September 2015, now-Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he never lobbied Florida Governor Jeb Bush for casino gambling because ‚Äúhe would‚Äôve gotten it, if I wanted it.‚Äù But if that is true, then Donald Trump committed yet another yet another felonious offense by the racist mogul ‚Äì this time for for lying under oath in a civil court deposition, which is perjury, as Newsweek reports:

One of these stories is a lie‚Äîa detailed, self-serving fabrication. But unlike the mountain of other lies he has told, this time the character trait that leads to Trump‚Äôs mendacity is on full display: He makes things up when he doesn‚Äôt want to admit he lost.

Assume the story he told at the debate is the lie. Even though Bush‚Äôs story reinforced what Trump was saying at rallies‚Äîhe had played the ‚Äúcash for outcomes‚Äù political game for years‚Äîhe could not admit he had tried to do the same in Florida because he could not bring himself to say that he had lost. Instead, he looked America in the eye and lied. And then he felt compelled to stack on another boast: His people are so wonderful that they would have gotten casino gambling in Florida, regardless of Bush‚Äôs opposition‚Äîif Trump had wanted it.

The transcripts below will show you there was a dispute of fact between two candidates, but not just any fact, a fact which Jeb Bush would‚Äôve full well known, as would have Trump. Because after Trump‚Äôs na√Øve attempt to muscle gambling into Florida over the objections of an anti-gambling Republican governor failed, he sued his former employee for his own failure. Eichenwald‚Äôs point is that either Trump lied baldly to the face of a former elected official on national television (and moderators let him get away with it unchecked) or:

Now consider the other option, that Trump committed perjury in the 2007 testimony. There, he admitted pushing for casino gambling in Florida, but said he would have gotten what he wanted if he hadn‚Äôt been tricked by Fields. The rationale for the perjurious testimony is simple‚ÄîTrump wants money from a man who stopped working for him and, once again, the story lets him deny he is anything less than perfect.

Why is all of this important? In the late 1990s, House Republicans impeached Democratic President Bill Clinton for allegedly lying in a deposition about a sensitive personal offense to his wife. The entire media hounded President Clinton over the Whitewater ‚Äúscandal‚Äù for half of the decade and it was the only thing they could find.

Republicans selected a nominee who is legendary for his lies, but unlike Trump‚Äôs other tall tales and obvious gaslighting, this lie was either told to a Florida court of law under oath (it does seem like Trump lives in the Florida court system at times) or to national television and his party‚Äôs base to discredit his opponent by turning the truth on it‚Äôs head.

Trump‚Äôs penchant for turning the truth upside down is not only a disastrous character flaw, but it‚Äôs a mortal danger to our national safety that he is even on the ballot as a major party candidate for President.

See for yourself the two transcripts Newsweek published and decide for yourself if Trump perjured himself to the court or lied to the Republican debate audience. Compare the two options presented by Eichenwald, there‚Äôs no third option here:

Bush: ‚ÄúThe one guy that had some special interests that I know of that tried to get me to change my views on something‚Äîthat was generous and gave me money‚Äîwas Donald Trump. He wanted casino gambling in Florida.‚Äù Trump interrupted Bush: Trump: I didn‚Äôt‚Äî Bush: Yes, you did. Trump: Totally false. Bush: You wanted it, and you didn‚Äôt get it, because I was opposed to‚Äî Trump: I would have gotten it. Bush: Casino gambling before‚Äî Trump: I promise, I would have gotten it. Bush: During and after. I‚Äôm not going to be bought by anybody. Trump: I promise, if I wanted it, I would have gotten it. Bush: No way. Believe me. Trump: I know my people. Bush: Not even possible. Trump: I know my people.

Transcript of 2007 Trial Deposition:

A lawyer asked Trump, ‚ÄúDid you yourself do anything to obtain any of the details with respect to the Florida gaming environment, what approvals were needed and so forth?‚Äù Trump: A little bit. Lawyer: What did you do? Trump: I actually spoke with Governor-Elect Bush; I had a big fundraiser for Governor-Elect Bush‚Ä¶and I think it was his most successful fundraiser, the most successful that he had had up until that point, that was in Trump Tower in New York on Fifth Avenue. Lawyer: When was that? Trump: Sometime prior to his election. Lawyer: You knew that Governor Bush, Jeb Bush at that time, was opposed to expansion of gaming in Florida, didn‚Äôt you? Trump: I thought that he could be convinced otherwise. Lawyer: But you didn‚Äôt change his mind about his anti-gaming stance, did you? Trump: Well, I never really had that much of an opportunity because Fields resigned, telling me you could never get what we wanted done, only to do it for another company.

"Many individuals tuned into the 90-minute commercial-free debate on CNN and many of them turned the event into a drinking game, as Americans often do. However, the US Surgeon General warns that playing a game involving drinking each time Donald Trump tells a lie could result in alcohol poisoning.

Last year, during the GOP debates, the Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, warned to Americans that engaging in drinking games could be hazardous, ""especially with the field the republicans are giving us this year."" Murthy acknowledged that Americans play drinking games during debates and that they needed to be careful while doing so if we're drinking when candidates are lying. During the debates of 2012, there was about 70,000 alcohol-poison related instances which occurred, and the Surgeon General warned everyone of this danger in 2015

The story was no different prior to the first presidential debate between Clinton and Trump on Monday, Sept. 26, 2016. The US Surgeon General warned that drinking when Trump lied could result in alcohol poisoning and facts back up his claims.

According to Politco, Donald Trump accumulated 87 lies in their study lasting from Sept. 15 to Sept. 20. Yes, in 5-day period Donald Trump lied 87 times, according to Politico's ""rigorous fact-checking"" which involved statements made by both Trump and Clinton. The study was conducted following Trump's statement on the ""birther moment"" and how Clinton, not he, started it in 2008. Trump's 87 lies over a five-day period averaged out to him telling a lie about every three minutes and 15 seconds over five hours of remarks.

So, in terms of this average, Trump probably told about 28 lies during the CNN Presidential debate between him and Clinton. The Surgeon General warned Americans to be cautious and said that first-responders were bracing themselves to handle alcohol-related issues following Clinton and Trump's CNN debate.

So, Americans cannot say they were not warned to be cautious about playing drinking games regarding Trump's habit of lie-telling. There are still a few debates ahead of us before the Nov. 8 election, so if you're going to drink during them keep it responsible. Baby sips for Trump's lies."

Hillary Clinton was almost universally declared the winner of tonight‚Äôs debate by the mainstream media, but online polls and twitter trends said otherwise. The #TrumpWon hashtag soon began circulating and eventually was the top Trend in the United States.

The #1 trend on Twitter right now is #TrumpWon ‚Äì thank you! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016

What‚Äôs curious about that is not that it was trending but where it originated from ‚Äì which will come as quite a surprise:

Data is from Trendsmap.com

That‚Äôs right- the #TrumpWon hashtag originated in St. Petersberg, Russia, where dictator Vladimir Putin is known to house his army of hundreds of paid cyber-trolls and bloggers, who work overtime to advance Putin‚Äôs agenda as part of a strategy known as dezinformatsiya. It‚Äôs a classic disinformation campaign working to sow discord and provoke conflict, to exacerbate divisions and amplify rivalries among the allies of those that would threaten Moscow. Putin‚Äôs trolls have already been caught flooding American social media circles with pro-Trump and pro-Putin propaganda as the Russian state-controlled media promotes Trump to their European audiences.

Putin is working hard to try to tip the scales in favor of Trump, who he knows he can manipulate into lifting the harsh economic sanctions level led against Russian oligarchs by the Obama administration after the Russian annexation of Crimea in 2014 and will turn a blind eye to further Russian aggression in Eastern Europe.

The Guardian reached out to some ex-bloggers and they described their working conditions as those akin to an internet sweat shop: ‚Äúhumourless and draconian, with fines for being a few minutes late or not reaching the required number of posts each day. Trolls worked in rooms of about 20 people, each controlled by three editors, who would check posts and impose fines if they found the words had been cut and pasted, or were ideologically deviant.‚Äù

So remember ‚Äì don‚Äôt trust online polls or argue with idiots in the comments section. It might be a Russian blogger making $800 a month in a a dark dungeon just trying to get by.

S Trump‚Äôs number one backer in Silicon Valley just had his secretive data company slapped with a major federal lawsuit for employment discrimination. The U.S. Department of Labor filed suit charging that Palantir Technologies, the Palo Alto technology company controlled by Republican businessman Peter Thiel, accusing him of systematically discriminating against Asian job applicants in the company‚Äôs hiring process. Palantir is a federal government contractor to the NSA.

Sources say that Donald Trump wants to deliver a lifetime Supreme Court nomination to Thiel, who despises the First Amendment‚Äôs protections, anti-trust laws that break up monopolies and generally dislikes the institutions of democracy. Both the Stanford law school grad Thiel and Trump‚Äôs campaign later denied the report. Vanity Fair noted that:

According to the lawsuit, Palantir looked at a pool of 130 applicants for its engineering intern positions: 73 percent of those who applied were Asian. Ultimately, the lawsuit says, the company hired four Asians and 17 non-Asians. ‚ÄúThe likelihood that this result occurred according to chance is approximately one in a billion,‚Äù the lawsuit says.

Ironically, Peter Thiel, the Trump donor who Bloomberg called the Republican nominee‚Äôs most unlikely supporter, is himself a first generation immigrant. Thiel‚Äôs parents came to America to find work in a high tech field, but now he‚Äôs supporting a candidate that opposes immigration altogether.

Thiel was a PayPal co-founder and early Facebook investor, but remained relatively unknown outside of tech circles until earlier this year. The billionaire revealed himself in March to be Hulk Hogan‚Äôs secret benefactor funding the bogus lawsuit that bankrupted Gawker, in retaliation for revealing the billionaire‚Äôs then-secret sexual orientation.

But now, the entire world knows Mr. Thiel prefers male company, after he delivered a very personal political address at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. Thiel then called out the GOP‚Äôs bathroom law obsessions as wrong and said, ‚ÄúEvery American has a unique identity. I‚Äôm proud to be gay, I‚Äôm proud to be a Republican,‚Äù after a lengthy rant against ‚Äúgovernment incompetence.‚Äù He became the first ever openly gay speaker at the RNC to acknowledge his sexual orientation on the dais, and only the second speaker to be openly gay period.

Unfortunately, his own party didn‚Äôt pay much attention to the speech, which was surprisingly well received inside the hall (as you can see below), because they passed the most anti-LGBT platform in party history this year, which speaks volumes when you consider that the Bush Administration used anti-marriage equality ballot initiatives to draw support from their base of bigots and haters throughout the early 2000s.

‚ÄúFederal contractors have an obligation to ensure that their hiring practices and policies are free of all forms of discrimination,‚Äù said the Department of Labor‚Äôs OFCCP Director Patricia Shiu. ‚ÄúOur nation‚Äôs taxpayers deserve to know that companies employed with public funds are providing equal opportunity for job seekers.‚Äù Lisa Gordon, a spokeswoman for Palantir, said the company will defend itself ‚Äúvigorously‚Äù and denies allegations of bias in a statement to Bloomberg News.

Now, the executive who accused his employer ‚Äì the federal government ‚Äì of incompetence will have to prove in a legal action that his company‚Äôs hiring practices were competent, in the face of daunting evidence to the contrary.

Add your name to millions demanding that Congress take action on the President‚Äôs crimes. IMPEACH DONALD TRUMP!"
"Note In Arabic Found With NYC Bomb‚Ä¶ Call Says There Will Be More Bombings

Police have found some very disturbing leads in the Chelsea bombing this last Saturday. The greatest suspicion is Muslim extremists who are claiming credit for the terror that injured dozens. The bomb in Chelsea injured 29 people, all discharged from the hospital. Another pressure-cooker bomb was found stashed in a Dumpster four blocks away.

Police are investigating just WHAT happened. While the leads come in, there are three in particular that have grabbed the attention of the press:

Lead #1 ‚Äì A hand-written letter, a portion of which was in Arabic, was found inside the plastic bag that also held the second device.

Lead #2 ‚Äì A 911 unidentified male caller warned of further explosions and the call went like this: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm looking at the explosion down the block. There will be more.‚Äù

How can you tell when a man is so far gone that he‚Äôs obviously not fit to stand on a stage for 90 minutes? That opinion would likely differ from psychologist to psychologist, but certainly there are warning signs.

Donald Trump has been running full-steam now for months. He‚Äôs constantly on the campaign trail, under the hot lights of the cameras with little time for rest. He‚Äôs a 70-year-old man and he refuses to let up. He‚Äôs been not only preparing for a debate with a world-class politician (no matter how much he denies it he knows the truth) and to ‚Äúrelax‚Äù he flies to Roanoke last-minute to hold a rally.

It‚Äôs obviously catching up to him. Sunday night, less than 24 hours before he‚Äôs set to walk into the hall to get ready for the most important night of his life, Donald Trump is showing signs that he‚Äôs simply taken this thing too far and gone off the deep end. This incoherent tweet covers three topics that are completely unrelated. It shows that Trump‚Äôs mind is prone to wandering and while each topic by itself may have been a talking point used to pander to somebody, together it‚Äôs just gibberish:

Five people killed in Washington State by a Middle Eastern immigrant. Many people died this weekend in Ohio from drug overdoses. N.C. riots! ‚Äî Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 26, 2016

Just‚Ä¶what is he talking about? If you‚Äôre trying to court the people you want to scare into voting for you, you talk about terrorism. If you want to court moderates concerned that drugs are seeping into the middle-class like never before you talk about opioid deaths. If you want to pander to your low-hanging fruit and court the racists you talk about riots in North Carolina.

Talking about them together shows just one thing: Trump is coming unhinged. He‚Äôs obviously not ready and maybe even unfit to debate Hillary Clinton. This could be the end of the line for the Trump train.

"Secret Video Records MASSIVE Hillary Event Flop!

Soooo embarrassing for Hillary, Clinton. In Delaware, Ohio, Clinton was supposed to have a door-knocking event at 1 pm in the afternoon. One guy, who was documenting it for Donald Trump, showed up. He was it. No one came at all‚Ä¶ when the staffers finally figured out who he was, they had him leave, but not before he got a gander at a whole lot of no one.

I watched South Park last week and they joked that Clinton had maybe four supporters. It‚Äôs looking more and more like that is just about right. There are over 2 million people in that area and no one could be bothered to show up for the Hildabeast.

From Gateway Pundit:

At Hillary Clinton‚Äôs Ohio campaign headquarters, volunteers were supposed to show up in droves to knock on doors for the Democratic presidential nominee. But, when this Donald Trump supporter showed up to the headquarters to check out the crowd, he found no one there. √ó 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

When the man said he was a Trump supporter and asked where all the volunteers were, they quickly showed him the door.

The staffers for Hillary Clinton had expected door knockers to show up in droves. They must have been so disappointed.

The Clinton campaign office was well stocked and neat. It was clearly ready to handle a large number of volunteers. The fact that no one showed indicates her ground game is in real trouble. If this is the case in all states out there, she will get clobbered by Donald Trump in the coming election. I wonder if you go to events like this in each state for Clinton what you would find. I have a feeling it will be eerily similar. This has got to have the Democrats in a panic.

Hillary Clinton is supposed to be the favorite here‚Ä¶ the one with the overwhelming advantage in the election. If that is true, where is everyone? Trump‚Äôs rallies are packed with thousands of people‚Ä¶ he‚Äôs making her look ridiculous. There is more enthusiasm for an old shoe than for Clinton at this point. Clinton is spending millions (that she has stolen or gotten from our enemies) to staff these offices. When support is non-existent like this, you have to wonder what is the point.

Between Trump leading in the polls, the enthusiasm factor, Hillary‚Äôs health, her corruption and terrorism concerns, it‚Äôs beginning to look more and more likely that the Trumpster will be the next president."
"CNN FURIOUS and Embarrassed After Trump Called Them Out For One Major Thing

This weekend, a bombing in New York City rocked the nation as Americans everywhere wondered if we were under attack again. Donald Trump responded to the attack almost immediately, accurately describing it as a ‚Äúbombing/‚Äù CNN, for some inexplicable reason, criticized him for that ‚Äî even though Hillary Clinton described the attack the exact same way. So CNN edited out Hillary‚Äôs wording. And Donald Trump just ripped them a new one for it.

Both times, the network did not air Clinton‚Äôs own description of the attack as a bombing, even though it happened just seconds before she answered the reporter‚Äôs question.

"New York bomb Suspect SUED Police!

Now we find out that not only is Ahmad Rahami a terrorist and a murderer, he‚Äôs an entitled whiner. Ahmad Rahami reported in a lawsuit that cops in Elizabeth, New Jersey were subjecting his family to discrimination because of their culture. Ironically, he was arrested for planting bombs around the Tri-state area‚Ä¶ you know, his culture.

In the lawsuit, the family complained that local officials were trying to shut down their chicken restaurant that they had owned since 2002. The family complained of receiving many tickets and court summons which had no grounds according to them. Ahmad, 28, his father Mohammad Sr., 53, and his brother Mohammad, brought the lawsuit together and said that local residents also racially abused them and said: ‚ÄòMuslims don‚Äôt belong here‚Äô. The lawsuit, filed in the federal court in Newark, says that the family are from Afghanistan and are all Muslims who have owned the chicken restaurant since 2002.

From April 2009 for two years they allege that they were unfairly targeted for staying open past 10pm despite being permitted to do so. √ó 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

"Back when the news first broke about the pay-to-play corruption involving then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation ‚Äì where donors to the foundation were granted political access, including lavish White House State dinners ‚Äì the Clinton campaign responded by focusing on all the supposed ‚Äúgood‚Äù that the foundation has done over the years.

I don‚Äôt think anyone was fooled into thinking that the Clinton Foundation was anything other than a money-making machine for the Clinton family and their well-connected friends. The foundation had to at least have the appearance of being a charity, so they had to divert some of their resources to causes. That way, they could always point to those grants as evidence that they‚Äôre an organization for good.

The Daily Caller reported that only 5.7 percent of the money they raked in went to actual charity:

Just 5.7 percent of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs massive 2014 budget actually went to charitable grants, according to the tax-exempt organization‚Äôs IRS filings. The rest went to salaries and employee benefits, fundraising and ‚Äúother expenses.‚Äù The Clinton Foundation spent a hair under $91.3 million in 2014, the organization‚Äôs IRS filings show. But less than $5.2 million of that went to charitable grants. That number pales in comparison to the $34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries, compensation and employee benefits. Another $50.4 million was marked as ‚Äúother expenses,‚Äù while the remaining almost $851K was marked as ‚Äúprofessional fundraising expenses.‚Äù Despite taking in an additional $30 million in 2014, the Clinton Foundation spent 40 percent less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013. Even as it slashed charitable spending, the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries, employee benefits and compensation by $5 million in 2014. The foundation also spent $5 million more ‚Äúother expenses‚Äù in 2014.

Sometimes, things are exactly as they appear. This was nothing more than a way for the Clintons to make massive amounts of money. And Hillary used her position as Secretary of State to pull money from rich people in exchange for political favors.

"Obama‚Äôs Speech In New York Shocks Americans When He Says THIS About Attacks!

Well apparently your President doesn‚Äôt have any such feelings about the matter. In fact, not only did he not talk about the bombings while he was in New York, he ignored them in favor of speaking at a high-dollar fundraiser.

Are you outraged yet?

It gets better.

"Over the past several months, the American public has become increasingly aware of the massive corruption that has taken place at the Clinton Foundation since Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.

Well, a new report suggests that the foundation is in even more trouble than previously thought. According to the Daily Caller, the foundation, AIDS program distributed ‚Äúwatered down‚Äù drugs to third-world countries.

From The Daily Caller:

Former President Bill Clinton and his Clinton Health Access Initiative (CHAI) distributed ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù HIV/AIDs drugs to patients in sub-Saharan Africa, and ‚Äúlikely increased‚Äù the risks of morbidity and mortality, according to a draft congressional report obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation. ‚Äî The CHAI program to help AIDS victims is considered one of the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs most important contributions and is probably its best known initiative. ‚Äî The possibility that CHAI distributed adulterated and diluted AIDS drugs to Third World victims could shake the foundations of the Clinton charity and spark a new round of scrutiny in the final weeks of presidential candidate Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. ‚Äî The congressional study also highlighted the unseemly ties between Bill and two controversial Indian-Americans who have been investigated and sanctioned by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The most troubling revelations concern the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs vigorous promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù drugs.

This latest report proves that the Clinton Foundation should be SHUT DOWN immediately rather than serve as a means of enriching Bill and Hillary!

Do you think that the Clinton Foundation should be shut down immediately before it continues to harm more and more people around the world? Share your thoughts below!"
"According to this, the Arizona state legislature needs some remedial courses on how to word their bills so that they don‚Äôt end up with laws that unintentionally ban perfectly normal parenting activities.

Case in point.

The specific law criminalizes ANY contact between an adult and a child‚Äôs genitals, so if you‚Äôre a parent of a child and you‚Äôve changed his/her diaper, or given him/her a bath, you‚Äôre a felon. For real.

This is what happens when you have terrible legislators who pass laws forbidding people from ‚Äúintentionally or knowingly touching‚Äù the genitals of a child under the age of 15. Of course, their intention is to protect children from child molesters, but because they don‚Äôt know how to write effective legislation, AZ parents are now criminals if they dare to bathe their own kids.

The AZ Supreme Court, then, decided to double down, insisting that ‚Äúprosecutors are unlikely to charge parents engaged in innocent conduct.‚Äù They ruled that defendants will be required to prove their lack of sexual intent. So much for innocent-until-proven-guilty, right?

In others words, just trust the prosecutors, y‚Äôall. There‚Äôs no need to rewrite or revise a terrible law that criminalizes normal behavior, because prosecutors will use common sense. See? Just trust them.

Wow.

There are a whole bunch of legal implications to consider here, and you can read those in detail at the sourcelink. But here‚Äôs an especially interesting tidbit:

As Fordham law professor John Pfaff explains, the majority‚Äôs logic has one final defect: It utterly ignores the reality of plea bargaining, which is how more than 90 percent of criminal cases in America are resolved. Given the immense expense and hassle of a trial, many defendants are pressured into striking a deal with a prosecutor, trading a lighter sentence for an admission of guilt. Arizona prosecutors can now dangle the threat of a probable child molestation conviction to coerce any parent of a young child into taking a plea deal on unrelated charges. With the state Supreme Court‚Äôs help, Arizona‚Äôs child molestation laws have been weaponized into a tool for prosecutorial harassment, allowing the state to target any parent or caregiver‚Äîout of spite or malice, or simply to boost their conviction rates. This terrible decision has gutted constitutional rights and turned many of the state‚Äôs residents into unknowing criminals. Barring intervention by the U.S. Supreme Court, due process has now been suspended for Arizona‚Äôs parents and caregivers.

Yikes.

But I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll all just work itself out. We should just trust the government on this, y‚Äôall. Because doesn‚Äôt government always know best?"

I mean, how do you expect to influence how people think when they are allowed to teach their own children?

For an additional wave of nausea, read Hillary go on and on about her ‚Äúfaith‚Äù and how it has led her to her progressive/liberal ideology.

Of course, Michelle Obama herself said that she has no plans to slow down her attack on the way we raise our own kids, as reported by The Washington Post.

Back in February, she said at a health-care summit that she does not plan to slow down on her healthy living campaign for kids, either. ‚ÄúI do not have a one- or two-year horizon for this work,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI have a rest-of-my-life horizon.‚Äù

This reeks of desperation. Is Hillary trying to capture the ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like Hillary, but I do like the Obamas‚Äù vote? Or maybe she thinks that with a woman of color at the helm, people will find it harder to speak out about the indoctrination taking place because, you know, racism or something.

Either way, I‚Äôm absolutely uncomfortable with the idea of progressives taking the reins of the education of American children.

This is just criminal and it is no surprise it involves the Clinton Health Access Initiative.

‚ÄúThe question becomes, ‚Äòhow many people lost their lives, how many people found it was a false promise,‚Äô‚Äù asked Blackburn in an interview with the DCNF.

This could definitely bring further scrutiny to the Clinton charities and to the Clintons themselves. Right when they need it least. A congressional study has uncovered inappropriate ties between Bill Clinton and the two Indian-Americans who were investigated and sanctioned by the FDA and the SEC. What is very troubling is the Clinton Foundation‚Äôs aggressive promotion of Ranbaxy despite mounting evidence that the Indian firm had persistently poor quality control and attempted to cover it up through either faulty or fraudulent reporting to the FDA. It is unclear at this juncture how many AIDS patients received the ‚Äúwatered-down‚Äù drugs. But that it happened at all, surely resulted in many deaths and is just monstrous. All for money.

ProPublica estimated that in 2007 alone, the US Agency for International Development allocated $9 million to Ranbaxy and delivered ‚Äúmore than $1.8 million packages.‚Äù ‚ÄúSubstandard HIV medicines cause health problems for patients, perhaps even accelerating death from HIV-related infections,‚Äù Roger Bate, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute who researches substandard and counterfeit medicines, told the DCNF.

Ranbaxy‚Äôs generic drugs are banned in the US, but they are still selling and distributing HIV/AIDs drugs worldwide. The Clinton Foundation and Clinton‚Äôs charity have not severed ties with them either.

Companies that partner with The Clinton Foundation and charities make a ton of money. Corruption is rampant. Bill and Hillary Clinton obviously care nothing about black people or humans in general‚Ä¶ their primary interest is monetary."
"BREAKING: Judge DEMANDS Release Of Clinton‚Äôs Security Training Files ‚Äì She Has 5 Days‚Ä¶

Just like Barack Obama and many people in his orbit, Hillary Clinton and her minions could never, ever in a million years pass a background security check. There are probably numerous terrorists who have cleaner backgrounds than these people and that‚Äôs no joke. They shouldn‚Äôt be cleared to clean a toilet there.

The Daily Caller News Foundation has been trying to get documents from the State Department forever concerning Clinton and her top aides completing recommended security training, briefings or courses on said security. Not only are these people willing morons concerning security, they have no desire to find out what they should and shouldn‚Äôt do. It‚Äôs called deniable plausibility. The Daily Caller News Foundation filed a FOIA lawsuit to get these people to produce mountains of documents. Will they see them before the election? A judge has ordered it‚Ä¶ I wouldn‚Äôt hold my breath.

From The Daily Caller:

A frustrated federal judge ordered the State Department to begin producing within five days hundreds of documents on whether required or recommended security training, briefings or courses were completed by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and her top aides. Judge Richard Leon ruled Tuesday in favor of The Daily Caller News Foundation by rejecting the State Department‚Äôs motion to dismiss TheDCNF‚Äôs Freedom of Information Act lawsuit concerning production of the documents originally sought under the Freedom of Information Act. But he also denied TheDCNF‚Äôs request to depose State Department officials. √ó 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life. Gleaned from a lifetime of trial, error, and writing it down, Hawkins provides advice everyone can benefit from in short, digestible chapters. Buy Now The State Department has been unable to produce any records confirming that Clinton and her top aides received mandatory annual security briefings about the proper handling of classified materials and the proper methods for conducting secure communications. In addition to Clinton, TheDCNF seeks the same records for former Clinton Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills, Deputy Chief of Staff Huma Abedin and Advisor Jacob Sullivan.

Huma Abedin is especially suspect in security matters here. But these corruptocrats have not complied with anything else yet, I don‚Äôt look for them to do so this time. And for some reason they are never held to account for it. The rest of us would be in jail‚Ä¶ guess we just aren‚Äôt the ‚Äòright people‚Äô.

Judge Richard Leon is getting fed up with State Department foot-dragging in releasing the documents. He ordered the department to release one third of the 400 documents by Sept. 26th and the rest of them by Oct. 10th. Bradley Moss, one of the attorneys representing TheDCNF, said ‚ÄúJudge Leon‚Äôs Order made clear his frustration with the State Department‚Äôs continued obstruction of the FOIA process. State will either meet his deadline or face the consequences of failure.‚Äù I hope they carry through with those consequences this time. It‚Äôs getting trite with the finger wagging and admonitions while just letting them get away with hell. The word for this is ‚Äòcorruption‚Äô.

State Department officials admitted in a July 29th response to TheDCNF that their failure to produce the requested documents meant the ‚Äúcourses were not completed‚Äù by Clinton or her aides. Well, duh. That‚Äôs for peons, not the elite evidently."
"There‚Äôs already been hints from NBC News that Lester Holt, the moderator for the first presidential debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, will not be fact checking the candidates. This, of course, will allow Trump to say anything he pleases without being held accountable ‚Äì except by Hillary Clinton.

But to make matters worse, all cable news networks (including those critical of Trump) are pledging to be completely spineless, and will not offer any on-screen fact checks to any comments made by the candidates that are wrong:

While on-screen fact-checking could help expose inaccurate or misleading assertions without interrupting the flow of the debate, nearly all of the major cable or broadcast networks, including Univision and Telemundo, said that they would not use any sort on screen fact check or graphics ‚Ä¶. Thus, the burden of keeping the candidates honest will likely come down to Holt, the only other person on the stage.

After Politico documented that Trump lies on average every three-and-a-half minutes, one would think a fact checking process would be paramount to an honest, open debate on the issues. But sadly, the media, realizing their ratings are on the line, would rather kowtow to Donald Trump and his band of deplorable surrogates.

The Clinton campaign has been forceful in its effort to hold Trump accountable, with Clinton Campaign Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri telling reporters:

For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage. We do believe it is the role of the moderator ‚Ä¶ to call out those lies and to do that in real time.

Unfortunately, with Trump‚Äôs impending lies already on the brink of not being checked for falsehoods, it‚Äôs somehow up to Hillary Clinton to ‚Äúshine‚Äù at the debate if she hopes to ‚Äúwin.‚Äù This double standard that the most qualified woman to every run for office has to go above and beyond that most unqualified nominee in history, just to look slightly better than him, is abhorrent.

Hopefully, Clinton will wipe the floor with Trump on the first debate, but with no one to back her up, it may be hard convincing the American people that she did it.

If there is one thing this election has shown us, it‚Äôs that journalism is dying, if not already dead.

One of former President Bill Clinton‚Äôs oldest friends has come forward and said what she believed was wrong with Democrat presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, and if she‚Äôs right, it could be detrimental to the former secretary of state.

Dolly Kyle, author of ‚ÄúHillary the Other Woman,‚Äù said Clinton has been ‚Äú‚Äôcruisin‚Äô for a bruisin‚Äô,‚Äù because she‚Äôs so angry and driven by rage. ‚ÄúPeople like that eventually break down, physically.‚Äù

‚ÄúHillary Clinton is not physically fit to be president,‚Äù Kyle told WND. ‚ÄúAnyone who believes that she is has their eyes closed. If she was in a wheelchair or blind or something like that, she could still do the job. But she is losing her mental capabilities, she‚Äôs suffering from real cognitive impairment.‚Äù

Kyle, an award-winning lawyer, also said Clinton is showing evidence of emotional instability, memory loss and difficulty carrying out tasks.

These symptoms coupled with Clinton‚Äôs paranoia and desire to control could only result in a psychological disaster.

‚ÄúThat paranoia, that tendency to be a control freak, has always been a part of her personality,‚Äù Kyle said, and it‚Äôs simply not a good combination for anyone ‚Äî much less the president of the United States.

Kyle said she wrote her book because she wanted everyone to know the truth about Hillary Clinton ‚Äî and Clinton‚Äôs health was just one troubling aspect of a larger picture.

Clinton is addicted to power, and will stop at nothing to get what she wants ‚Äî even if it means jeopardizing her health and the Democrat party, according to Kyle.

‚ÄúShe has been running for president ever since she took hold of Billy Clinton‚Äôs coattails so many decades ago in 1971,‚Äù the lawyer said.

This was more bad news for Clinton, who has struggled to keep a positive image while deflecting scandals not only about her health but about her character and her ability to lead this country.

A random white guy was driving through the riots taking place in North Carolina when he was surrounded by the protesters/rioters. The photographer who witnessed the incident thought that he was going to get mugged, but for some reason they just let him through.

That seems very bizarre considering that we‚Äôve seen videos of rioters stopping cargo trucks, stealing the items within and lightening them on fire. That being the case, why would they just let one guy go?

Well, they saw what he was waving out the window and they must have thought that it was in their best interest to leave him alone.

While being white in the middle of an angry BLM mob would usually be a death sentence, this guy had thought ahead. When his car was surrounded, he calmly rolled down his window and let the protesters know that he had a handgun.

The group quickly dispersed and let the man continue driving to his destination.

This is exactly how people should handle these kinds of situations. Do you think that he did the right thing? Or should he just have driven through?"
"Chicago Environmentalist Scumbags

Leftists are in constant contradiction, like the Chicago environmentalist scumbags.

No matter the issue, Leftists are for it, before they are against it. As long as the issues doesn‚Äôt impact Liberals personally, they remain content.

Leftist support the military, until they decide to make the military into baby-killers. Also, Leftist embrace law enforcement, until it‚Äôs time for them decry law enforcement.

Now we have another such issue as reported in the Washington Times.

The same Chicago environmentalists who blocked filmmaker George Lucas from building a museum last month are now welcoming the nearby Obama presidential library, sparking accusations of political hypocrisy. Juanita Irizarry, executive director of Friends of the Parks, said Friday that her group is ‚Äúthrilled‚Äù to see Obama Presidential Center being built in a park on Chicago‚Äôs South Side. Just five weeks ago, the group forced Mr. Lucas to abandon his plans for a similar lakefront project about seven miles north of the proposed Obama site after a two-year legal battle.

So much for ‚Äúwhite privilege,‚Äù huh George?!

The Chicago environmentalist scumbags‚Äô decision contradicts their own charter.

The Obama center requires bulldozing trees and grass at Jackson Park. Meanwhile, the proposed Lucas museum would have been built on a parking lot used by Chicago Bears fans for tailgating. Let‚Äôs see; wrecking the environment for the black man‚Äôs library or razing a parking lot for the white guy. Every environmentalists dilemma?

When former U.S. Military Commander in Afghanistan, Stanley McChrystal, was called into the Oval Office by Barack Obama, he knew things weren‚Äôt going to go well when the President accused him of not supporting him in his political role as President. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not my job to support you as a politician, Mr. President, it‚Äôs my job to support you as Commander-in-Chief,‚Äù McChrystal replied, and he handed Obama his resignation.

Barack Obama has a long history of hating the US military and men and women who serve. He is never one to let someone have the last word but he failed in this instance.

Not satisfied with accepting McChrystal‚Äôs resignation the President made a cheap parting shot. ‚ÄúI bet when I die you‚Äôll be happy to pee on my grave.‚Äù The General saluted. ‚ÄúMr. President, I always told myself after leaving the Army I‚Äôd never stand in line again.

"SURPRISE! 70% Of Charlotte RIOTERS Are Not From There ‚Äì Guess What That Means‚Ä¶ [VIDEO]

Imagine that‚Ä¶ at least 70% of the rioters in Charlotte, North Carolina were bused in. They had out of state IDs. Looks like it was well planned. I know here in Tulsa, hubby had to leave work early yesterday. We got word that Black Lives Matter was busing people into Tulsa as well. In our case, things stayed pretty peaceful fortunately. They weren‚Äôt so lucky in Charlotte. The head of the police union there came right out and said these were professional criminals that were brought in.

This is the way the communists have organized these protests from the beginning. Wait for something to happen that causes outrage. Use the black community as useful tools for your agenda. Bus in outside radicals and then get your violence on. The people that are behind all this want race riots and chaos in our streets. Charlotte was a wild success for them‚Ä¶ Tulsa, not so much.

From Louder with Crowder:

Wait, the bulk of the people rioting in North Carolina are coming from out of state? Shut up. Generally speaking when there‚Äôs a riot like this, it‚Äôs all from people who are from the community, care about their community, and know what they‚Äôre even rioting about in the first place.

If you go back and look at some of the arrests that were made last night. I can about say probably 70% of those had out-of-state IDs. They‚Äôre not coming from Charlotte.‚Äù

I think the reason it did not work here in Tulsa is that the populace here is not nearly so sympathetic to Black Lives Matter. Also, the police officer who shot the black man has now been charged with Manslaughter. I still contend she had grounds to shoot the guy, but the charge probably diffused the situation somewhat. Charlotte has a large Black Lives Matter contingent and since there have been other events there, it was primed already for a riot. It‚Äôs not a conservative haven anymore and works well for their political agenda.

These people don‚Äôt care about the facts or that black people are dying. They are looking for an excuse to riot and create chaos.

"EXPOSED: Soros Funding Fake Veterans‚Äô PAC To Take Trump Down

A couple months ago, Discover the Networks revealed a list of 187 groups who were funded by Soros. They have naturally been attacking the presidential candidate who is generally against their values like open borders, amnesty, giving illegals voting rights, Muslim migration and social justice. So, WHY then is Soros caught again?

Now a new organization is going after Trump and sure enough, they‚Äôre funded by Soros TOO! It‚Äôs called ‚ÄòCommon Defense PAC‚Äô and their mantra is: ‚ÄúAs veterans, we swore to protect the rights of every American. We continue to fulfill this promise by standing against Donald Trump.‚Äù

Then on the ‚Äòleadership team‚Äô page on the website it lists a bunch of military veterans with no contact information for them. On their social media you see the same stuff.

There‚Äôs a reason that it‚Äôs called terrorism. It‚Äôs because ISIS, and terrorist groups like them, use fear and propaganda as a means to intimidate people into getting what they want.

Now, the House Judiciary Committee has scheduled a hearing for September 28th that will decide Comey‚Äôs fate.

Former U.S. Attorney Joseph DiGenova has loudly called for Comey to resign and when that did not happen, demanded that he lose his job. ‚ÄúThis now gets to the point of a serious question as to the director‚Äôs fitness for office,‚Äù DiGenova said. He believes that the FBI should have had a grand jury convened and a subpoena issued for Mills‚Äô computer. ‚ÄúThe contours of this investigation are so embarrassing to the FBI because it is now clear that they immunized people who had criminal exposure and did not conduct a proper investigation before they gave immunity,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis was not a real investigation. This was a ‚Äòprotected investigation‚Äô designed to look like an investigation.‚Äù

DiGenova demanded that Congress hold hearings to look into the investigation and evidently, they listened. This week, Comey will have to answer for his behavior.

Will Congress hold Comey responsible for this joke of an investigation? He isn‚Äôt just having to face a hearing; he‚Äôs been issued a subpoena from Congress, too.

Congress has repeatedly requested that Comey provide certain documents on Clinton‚Äôs email scandal and he has repeatedly failed to provide them. In a further attempt to get Comey to comply, Lamar Smith of Texas has slapped Comey with a subpoena compelling him to cough up the documents.

How loyal is Comey to Hillary, really? Is he really willing to lose his career or even go to prison to cover for her? And if the answer to that question is ‚Äúyes,‚Äù then the new question becomes‚Ä¶ why?"
"Hillary‚Äôs TOP Donor Country Just Auctioned Off ISIS Sex Slaves‚Ä¶

Why in the hell do we still support Saudi Arabia? We don‚Äôt need their oil‚Ä¶ we would make do. The majority of the 9/11 terrorists came from Saudi Arabia, as does the Bin Laden family. The Saudi deputy crown prince told reporters in June the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has funded 20% of Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign. She‚Äôs taking money from a stone cold enemy and that‚Äôs not the only one by any means. You do not consort or take money from those who intend to destroy your country‚Ä¶ period. That goes for Middle Eastern countries such as Saudi Arabia, Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. It also includes any dictatorship or communist strongman. We never learn our lesson, do we?

Now it comes to light that Saudi Arabia is selling ISIS sex slaves off to the highest bidder at public auctions. Iraqis, Syrians, Saudis and WESTERNERS all bought slaves at the auction. This is monstrous and going on right out in the open. It should be stopped cold‚Ä¶ whatever it takes. Britain needs to stop selling the Saudis weapons and we need to pull our politicians out of the Saudi bedroom and back home. They are killing us and enslaving women and children. How can we silently stand by while this evil goes on?

From Jihad Watch:

It isn‚Äôt news that the Islamic State has long been abusing and trafficking sex slaves ‚Äì especially Yazidi girls ‚Äì but it has been now discovered that the sex slaves of IS are being ‚Äúsold in horrifying auctions to UK ally Saudi Arabia.‚Äù An eyewitness reported: √ó 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know by Sir John Hawkins John Hawkins's book 101 Things All Young Adults Should Know is filled with lessons that newly minted adults need in order to get the most out of life.

Buy Now Dozens of women were being held in a large room, and it was not only Iraqis and Syrians trading women but also Saudis and Westerners, whose actual nationality was not clear. Western women have also been reported to be among the victims in keeping with the Islamic State‚Äôs practice of enslaving kafir women: The Islamic State‚Äôs human trafficking operation includes enslaving women who they consider to be ‚Äòkafir‚Äô, non-Muslim people like Yazidis and Christians, before selling them for money. The depraved thugs are also involved in the radicalisation of young women all over the world and try to tempt them to come to their caliphate with false promises of wealth, marriage and forgiveness of sin.

As these women are ‚Äòrescued‚Äô from ISIS, they are not being given freedom. They are being sold on the auction block into a hellish existence. These are the people that Hillary Clinton takes money from, makes deals with and hobnobs with. Monsters of a feather.

I have said for a long time, not only are the Saudis sponsoring ISIS, so are the Russians. We are being played. Our own president is complicit. Let‚Äôs not elect another corrupt demon who cares nothing of women and children being sold to rapists. After all, Hillary Clinton is married to one."

The first presidential debate between Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican rival Donald Trump was fully of fiery exchanges between the two candidates, as well as several questionable moments.

NBC‚Äôs Lester Holt, the moderator for the debate, started getting flak before the debate was over after he repeatedly interrupted Trump to ‚Äúfact-check‚Äù him, except that his fact-checks were more or less wrong.

In one of the more contentious exchanges, Holt insisted that Trump had supported the Iraq War from the beginning, but Trump continuously denied it, USA Politics Today* reported.

Rather than ask Clinton why she voted for the war, Holt continued to press Trump, saying that in an interview with Fox News‚Äô Neil Cavuto, Trump expressed his support for the war.

After the debate was over, Cavuto aired the interview in question and showed that Trump wasn‚Äôt all gung-ho about invading Iraq before we went in ‚Äî he had his reservations.

‚ÄúYou know, what happened to the days of Douglas MacArthur? I mean he would go in and attack. He wouldn‚Äôt talk. I mean we have to, you know, it‚Äôs sort of like either do it or don‚Äôt do it,‚Äù Trump said.

‚ÄúWell, he‚Äôs (Bush) either got to do something or not do something perhaps. Because perhaps he shouldn‚Äôt be doing it yet. Perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations. You know, he‚Äôs under a lot of pressure,‚Äù said Trump, clearly unsure if invading Iraq was the right choice.

You can see it here:

Instead of hammering Trump for his alleged ‚Äúsupport‚Äù for the Iraq War, the moderator really should have asked Clinton why she voted to authorize the war when she had access to much more information than Trump did.

It shouldn‚Äôt surprise anyone that the mainstream media turned what could have been a substantive debate into a chance to try to smear Trump‚Äôs name.

Luckily, Trump held his own and showed that he could stand up to both Clinton and her media pals at the same time.

"Well THAT‚ÄôS Weird. If the Birther movement is racist‚Ä¶ does that mean that the person who wrote this had it in for Obama?

What if that person is ‚Ä¶ Obama?

Breitbart put this out, taken from the AP, entitled ‚Äú‚ÄúKenyan-born Obama all set for US Senate‚Äù That was June 2004.

Kenyan-born US Senate hopeful, Barrack Obama, appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival, Jack Ryan, dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations. The allegations that horrified fellow Republicans and caused his once-promising candidacy to implode in four short days have given Obama a clear lead as Republicans struggled to fetch an alternative. As far as we know, Barack Obama never refuted this article.

It‚Äôs still out there on the internet. Here‚Äôs a screen capture:

Here‚Äôs the bottom half of the same article with AP attribution.

And the link to the original.

That‚Äôs not actually as weird as the one all the way back in 1991.

That was Obama‚Äôs publicist. Here‚Äôs the quote:

Breitbart News has obtained a promotional booklet produced in 1991 by Barack Obama‚Äôs then-literary agency, Acton & Dystel, which touts Obama as ‚Äúborn in Kenya and raised in Indonesia and Hawaii.‚Äù The booklet, which was distributed to ‚Äúbusiness colleagues‚Äù in the publishing industry, includes a brief biography of Obama among the biographies of eighty-nine other authors represented by Acton & Dystel. It also promotes Obama‚Äôs anticipated first book, Journeys in Black and White‚Äìwhich Obama abandoned, later publishing Dreams from My Father instead.

If Obama is contradicting himself, the only real question is, which lie do we write of as him cynically manipulating an audience for personal gain?

If his birth in America is valid ‚Äî as we are led to believe? Why lie about it? Unless playing the ‚Äòforeigner‚Äô card gave him illegitimate access to preferential opportunities or tuition costs. In which case, he is a lying turd who cheated someone more deserving out of ‚Ä¶ whatever. A Harvard Education, possibly.

Because if That WASN‚ÄôT a lie‚Ä¶ then something else MUST be. That ‚Äòsomething else‚Äô being his American birth and Citizenship. Which are prerequisites to his presidency.

The quote can be read in context at Breitbart."

There‚Äôs a lot to be discussed about last night‚Äôs debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. One thing that has baffled many is how Hillary seemed so ready with answers and detailed facts and, almost as bizarrely, she didn‚Äôt cough or reach for water once.

Well, this twitter user might have an answer. Do you see it?

I think we all know why #TrumpWon pic.twitter.com/nwZRxvkX81 ‚Äî USA For Trump 2016 (@USAforTrump2016) September 27, 2016

This wouldn‚Äôt be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Is just a trick of light and shadows? A zipper? Or was Hillary actually hiding a ‚ÄúCough prevention machine‚Äù in her pantsuit?

"People Noticed Something Odd About Hillary‚Äôs Outfit at the Debate Last Night

There‚Äôs a lot that could be discussed about last night‚Äôs debate, like the unfair debate moderator asking questions to help Hillary, but that‚Äôs not the main concern right now.

There is one thing that has baffled many‚Ä¶. Hillary didn‚Äôt appear to be her usually stupid coughing self! She was so ready with answers and detailed facts. Almost just as bizarre was that not once did she sputter or reach for a glass of water. This is so odd that it has everyone and their grandma talking!

The latest question swirling around on social media are the pictures that appeared to show Hillary with some kind of flesh-colored device embedded inside her ear‚Ä¶is that an earpiece she is wearing? Or just something fashionable for old ladies?

Twitter may have figured out the answer‚Ä¶do you see it?

It certainly wouldn‚Äôt be the first time Hillary had to use a device for help. What do you think? Could it be a trick of light and shadows? A puffy zipper, perhaps? Or was Hillary actually hiding a ‚ÄúCough prevention machine‚Äù in her hideous feminist pantsuit?

Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign is fervently denying that she was wearing an earpiece.

Fox News reported that ‚ÄúClinton spokesman Nick Merrill said what is seen in the photo is merely a reflection of the TV lights or a flash.‚Äù

While we aren‚Äôt sure what was going on inside Hillary‚Äôs little head last night, we do have a very interesting email posted by Woods from Clinton and Huma Abedin that the WikiLeaks archive released, ‚ÄúDid u take your earpiece or do I need to get it?‚Äù

Woods had a hidden sense of humor that escaped him on twitter‚Ä¶‚ÄúShe can‚Äôt even #lie without help from a gaggle of other #liars through an earpiece.‚Äù

Then Woods added:

‚ÄúShe literally can‚Äôt help herself. She‚Äôs the kind of sociopath who will lie even if the truth were more beneficial.‚Äù

Of course, we don‚Äôt have actual proof of the earpiece, it could have just been a hearing aid. Hmmm no one has talked about Hillary wearing an earpiece in the past when she fumbled through her speeches.

Some claim it‚Äôs merely a reflection of studio lights. We‚Äôll let you be the judge."
